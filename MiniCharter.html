<h1>lua-users.org Mini Charter</h1>

<b>lua-users.org</b> is an internet site for and by users of the programming language Lua.

<h2>lua-users.org is not lua.org</h2>

The lua-users.org site will not be managed or hosted by the Lua authors or Tecgraf. However it can be considered a "blessed" community site for two reasons: 1) the Lua authors hold the registration of the lua-users.org domain and so ultimately decide where the domain points to, and 2) there is a link from the lua.org home page to lua-users.org. The lua-users.org home page will clearly state that it is not affiliated with Tecgraf.

<h2>lua-users.org main site</h2>

The main lua-users.org site may use free web hosting services and/or be funded by donations from the Lua community. In the case of community funding, each month a volunteer will be sought to pay the charges associated with the site. The account funded by the donations will only be used for content related to lua-users.org.

Members of the community proposing a plan for a particular content or service and also willing to volunteer the time for related setup and maintenance will be given access to the site account.

<h2>lua-users.org subdomains</h2>

It is possible to create subdomains of lua-users.org (for example, "xyz.lua-users.org"). This can be used by members wanting to set up content outside of the lua-users.org main site. However use of the main site is recommended if at all possible, since it motivates and makes the most efficient use of volunteer contributions.

<h2>content guidelines</h2>

Any software running on the site such as CGI scripts should be under BSD or GPL or similar free license. Any data related to the site content (for example, wiki database) should be backed up and made publicly available at regular intervals. One reason for this is if the individuals controlling the lua-users.org site should go astray (from the community's point of view), it will be possible to install the content at another location and the Lua authors can redirect the domain appropriately.
