Below are the questions which need to be answered for the Mentoring Organization Application.
<p>
Have at it!

<li> <strong>Describe your organization.</strong>
</UL>
<p>
<DL>
<dt><dd>The Lua community comprises the language authors (<a href="http://www.lua.org/authors.html">http://www.lua.org/authors.html</a>), developers who use Lua for their own applications (<a href="http://www.lua.org/uses.html">http://www.lua.org/uses.html</a>), and users who take advantage of the standalone scripting abilities of the language.  Most of the active development comes in the form of third party libraries and developing new techniques for using the existing facilities of the language.  Due to the breadth of focus in the community there are a range of active and open projects that students can become involved in.  These projects range from web development frameworks to open source video game engines written entirely in Lua.

<UL>
<li> <strong>Why is your organization applying to participate in GSoC 2008? What do you hope to gain by participating?</strong>
</UL>
<p>
<DL>
<dt><dd>Over the course of the past two years, there has been a surge in the popularity of Lua, and its more widespread adoption is evident by its promotion to the top 20 languages in the Tiobe Index (<a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html</a>).  As the language grows more popular there is a constant need for more bindings to third party libraries, as well as projects written solely in Lua.  Google Summer of Code 2008 is a great opportunity to expose students to open source software development by creating real solutions to fill existing needs.

<li> <strong>What criteria did you use to select these individuals as mentors? Please be as specific as possible.</strong>
</UL>
<p>
<p>
<UL>
<li> <strong>What is your plan for dealing with disappearing students?</strong>
</UL>
<p>
<p>
Our first strategy is to work hard to insure that students don't disappear.  The two most important factors in keeping students involved in their projects are frequent communication between mentor and student, particularly at the beginning of the project,  encouraging communication between the student and others in the Lua community, monitoring students' progress so they do not flounder when they run into difficulty, and structuring the project so that the time between achievable milestones is short.
<p>
<p>
<UL>
<li> <strong>What is your plan for dealing with disappearing mentors?</strong>
</UL>
We have identified a pool of Lua users with suitable knowledge to be tapped as backup mentors.  In addition, our backup organization administrator, a university faculty member, has a decade of experience in concurrently mentoring several student projects.  He is prepared to step into the role of Mentor for one or more projects as necessary.  
<p>
<p>
<UL>
<li> <strong>What steps will you take to encourage students to interact with your project's community before, during and after the program?</strong>
</UL>
As mentioned above, we have plans to foster communication between the students and the community as a means of keeping the students involved in their projects.  Specifically, we will schedule several presentation sessions (most likely through IRC) throughout the summer, post progress summaries to the Lua mailing list, create section of the lua-users wiki devoted to each project, recruit Lua community members to become early adopters of the students' efforts, and YYY.
<p>
<p>
<UL>
<li> <strong>What will you do to ensure that your accepted students stick with the project after GSoC concludes?</strong>
</UL>

<dt><dd>The ideas are all things that the community would actually use, if they are correctly implemented, so I think the ego boost of seeing your code get actual use would encourage the students to not abandon the project. -- <a href="../wiki/FabioMascarenhas.html" >FabioMascarenhas</a>
