This is a patch to improve support of coroutines in Lua 5.0.2.
Its main purpose is to remove the restrictions on yielding coroutines
from within metamethods or C functions to largest degree possible
without introducing operating system-dependence or reliance on
OS facilities such as threading libraries or C stack allocations.
<p>
Here is the patch: <a href="/files/wiki_insecure/power_patches/5.0/ejcoro.patch">Files:wiki_insecure/power_patches/5.0/ejcoro.patch</a>
<p>
What follows here is a poorly Wikified rendition of the readme file...
<p>
-Eric Jacobs
<p>
<hr>It is backwards compatible except to programs that look for the
specific error message "attempt to yield across metamethod/C-call boundary",
which has been changed to be more accurate and state which Lua API call
was used that was incompatible with yielding.
<p>
<H3>Theory of operation:</H3>
<p>
This patch uses a slightly different strategy to allow yielding than
Lua does in the standard case (Lua functions calling Lua functions).
In the standard case, Lua maintains a single set of C stack frames
for as many Lua frame (CallInfo<a href="/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=edit&amp;id=CallInfo" >?</a>'s) that are invoked using normal
function calls. The bottommost of these C stack frames is the main
loop of the interpreter, luaV_execute(). Calls from Lua to Lua are
accomplished without reentering luaV_execute; instead, the new
Lua frame is added or removed from the stack and a "goto" is executed
to restart the luaV_execute() C frame at an appropriate point.

This figure illustrates how the C stack and the Lua CallInfo<a href="/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=edit&amp;id=CallInfo" >?</a> frame
stack line up for the case of Lua functions calling Lua functions.
A single C frame of luaV_execute() maps to any number of Lua frames.
Note that the CI_CALLING flag is set in the functions which have made
calls this way.
<p>
When a metamethod or C function calls back into standard Lua, the
luaV_execute() function is reentered, and yields are prohibited.

</pre>
This figure shows how the C stack and Lua CallInfo<a href="/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=edit&amp;id=CallInfo" >?</a>'s line up for
the case of a metamethod or C function that calls Lua code. The
CI_CALLING flag is not set in this case. The dotted line represents
how the C stack is divided into two sets of C frames, one for each
of the Lua CallInfo<a href="/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=edit&amp;id=CallInfo" >?</a>'s. This line is exactly the boundary that standard
Lua won't let you yield across.                
<p>
One strategy for removing this limitation for metamethods would be to
make metamethod calls behave similarly to normal function calls for
Lua; i.e., they would not reenter luaV_execute() but simply "goto"
to the start of the luaV_execute() C frame that is already running.
While possibly feasible for pure Lua metamethods, this approach is
not satisfactory for use with C functions for the following two reasons:
<p>
<UL>
<li> Local variables
</UL>
<p>
C functions often store local variables on the C stack. In order to
maintain a single instance of luaV_execute(), those variables would
have to be moved off the C stack to somewhere else (e.g., the Lua
stack) in order to let the C stack unwind. This is not an issue for
Lua functions because Lua functions store their local variables on the
Lua stack anyway. However, for C functions, it would be mandatory to
unwind the stack in order to call back into Lua. This is an undesirable
requirement for C functions. Although it is necessary that the C
function be able to do in order to take full advantage of coroutines,
it is not necessary that they actually do it every time they want to
call back into Lua. If the called code never yields, it's simply a
waste of CPU time to transfer the variables back and forth.
<p>
<p>
This patch solves these problems by using an optimistic strategy. When
a call is made from a C function into Lua code, it is first assumed that
the Lua code will not yield, and the C stack is built up recursively
just as in standard Lua. If the called function completes without yielding,
the situation is exactly as it is in standard Lua. But suppose that the Lua
code instead yields:
<pre>

                +-----------------+        +------------+

            /---| coroutine.yield |        |  luaFunc2  |

            |   +-----------------+        |            |

       -1   |   |  luaV_execute   |&lt;======&gt;|            |  &lt;-

      Yield |   +-----------------+        +------------+    \

      return|   |     cFunc       |        |   cFunc   C|  &lt;-- CI_CALLING flag becomes set

      value |   +-----------------+        +------------+    /

            |   |  luaV_execute   |&lt;======&gt;|  luaFunc1  |  &lt;-

            v   +-----------------+        +------------+

                     C stack                Lua CallInfo's

</pre>                
The yield function generates a return value of -1. At this point, the
interpreter knows that the optimistic strategy won't work, and begins to
unwind the C stack. As the yield return value is propagated downwards,
each C frame is required to either save its state in the corresponding
Lua frame(s), set the CI_CALLING flag, and return -1, or else throw
an error saying that the yield can't be completed. It is at this point
that the error regarding an illegal yield will occur.
<p>
If the yield is successful, then the C stack is back to its unwound state,
and the Lua stack contains all of the state information. By waiting until
the -1 yield return value appears before asking C functions to save state,
we optimize for the case that a yield does not occur, while giving C functions
to opportunity to handle it if it does occur.
<p>
When the coroutine is resumed, the top CallInfo<a href="/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=edit&amp;id=CallInfo" >?</a> is examined just as in
current Lua. Because the stack has successfully unwound, the CI_CALLING
flag is set. This indicates that the code to complete the function call
(the call to luaD_poscall) isn't waiting on the C continuation, and we
need to figure out how to complete the function call and resume the
function based on CallInfo<a href="/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=edit&amp;id=CallInfo" >?</a> state. For Lua functions, this involves looking at
the opcode of the instruction at (ci-&gt;savedpc - 1). There is a switch
in a new function called luaV_return() that does this. For a C function,
it involves calling the C function again to ask it to resume itself.
There is a new user-defined integer/pointer union field in the CallInfo<a href="/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=edit&amp;id=CallInfo" >?</a>
structure that can be used by C functions in order to do this. This is
also handled by luaV_return().
<p>
Here's a summary of what the patch changes:
<p>
<UL>
<li> It is no longer automatically an error to call coroutine.yield() from within a metamethod or C function. Instead, the yield proceeds to try to unwind the C stack, and an error only occurs if at some point, a C function is unable to handle the yield request.
</UL>
<p>
The error message indicates which API call was used that could not
handle a yield.
<p>
<UL>
<li> All metamethods except __gc can be yielded from without error.
</UL>
<p>
<UL>
<li> An iterator function can yield without error.
</UL>
<p>
<UL>
<li> C functions which callback into Lua code will throw the error if the Lua code yields unless those functions are adapted to use the new "yp" (yield possible) API.
</UL>
<p>
<H2>New API functions:</H2>
<p>
int lua_call_yp (lua_State *L, int nargs, int nresults, int tailcall);
<p>
This function has the same meaning as lua_call(), except that it
will not prevent the called code from yielding. If a yield occurs,
the return value is -1. Otherwise, the return value is the actual
number of results.
<p>
The tailcall parameter should be set to 1 if this call is the
last operation that the C function is to do. In this case, if the
code yields, when it resumes, the results returned by the called
function will become the results of the C function. In this case,
the API can be called simply like this:
<p>
<DL>
<dt><dd>return lua_call_yp(..., 1);
</DL>
<p>
If the tailcall parameter is set to 0, and the code yields, when
it resumes, the C function will be reinvoked. The lua_call_yp()
returns -1 in this case, and the C function will need to save
the state of its local variables and other state to be able to
reconstruct them when the C function is reinvoked. It may use
the Lua stack for this purpose; however, it _may not push_ values
onto the Lua stack, as the called function(s) have taken the space
directly above the stack.
<p>
Probably the easiest way to do this for a lot of C functions is
to reserve a couple of slots in the stack which can be filled in
with numbers or perhaps userdata (with __gc metamethod set if
necessary for cleanup.)
<p>
When the C function is reinvoked, the Lua stack is how it would
be had the original lua_call_yp() succeeded, and it is legal to
push values on the stack again.
<p>
<p>
void *lua_get_frame_state (lua_State *L);
<p>
This function returns a pointer to a variable in the Lua stack
frame which may be used by C functions to retain state across
reinvocations of the C function. The return value may be cast to
an int * or void **. When the C function is first invoked, the
value of the frame state is always 0. Prior to returning -1 in case
of an API call that yielded, the C function should set the frame
state to a non-zero value, so that it will recognize that it is
being resumed the next time it is called.
<p>
Possible uses for the frame state value are: numeric counter for
simple loops, stack index of stored variables, or pointer to
userdata (the userdata must of course be stored in the stack somewhere
to prevent it from being collected.)
<p>
<p>
<UL>
<li> The following functions in the standard library have been converted to
</UL>
use the YP API:
<pre>

  table.foreachi()

  table.foreach()

  tostring()

  print()

  dofile()

  string.gsub()

</pre>
Consequently, the callback functions invoked from these functions are
able to yield.
<p>
<p>
<H2>Internal changes:</H2>
<p>
<UL>
<li> The code to finsh the execution of OP_CALL/OP_TAILCALL that appeared in resume() and luaV_execute() has been consolidated into a new function called luaV_return() which generalizes this operation for all opcodes which may be yielded out of, and for C functions which use the YP API calls to allow yields.
</UL>
<p>
These opcodes are:
<pre>  

      OP_CALL

      OP_TAILCALL

      OP_GETTABLE

      OP_GETGLOBAL

      OP_SELF

      OP_ADD

      OP_SUB

      OP_MUL

      OP_DIV

      OP_POW

      OP_CONCAT

      OP_UNM

      OP_LT

      OP_LE

      OP_EQ

      OP_SETTABLE

      OP_SETGLOBAL

      OP_TFORLOOP

</pre>      
luaV_return() is called from luaV_execute() during the
execution of OP_RETURN, and from resume() when a coroutine
is resumed.
<p>
<UL>
<li> luaD_precall() is no longer guaranteed to set up exactly one new CallInfo<a href="/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=edit&amp;id=CallInfo" >?</a> frame on the Lua stack. Instead, it may end up creating any number of frames. This is because luaD_precall() will try to invoke a C function immediately, which may call-back into Lua code and continue to set up CallInfo<a href="/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=edit&amp;id=CallInfo" >?</a> frames until it encounters a yield.
</UL>
<p>
<UL>
<li> The meaning of the CI_CALLING CallInfo<a href="/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=edit&amp;id=CallInfo" >?</a> flag has been slightly altered/clarified: (The name is not that descriptive anymore; not sure if it ever was...)
</UL>
<p>

<dt><dd>CallInfo<a href="/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=edit&amp;id=CallInfo" >?</a> to be returned to it via C-return, and which
<dt><dd>will execute luaD_poscall() with that return value to

<dt><dd>luaV_return() function must be called with a pointer
<dt><dd>to this CallInfo<a href="/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=edit&amp;id=CallInfo" >?</a> in order to resume it. luaV_return()
<dt><dd>handles the luaD_poscall() to deactivate that next

<dt><dd>

</DL>
Using this description, it is easy to see where CI_CALLING
must be set. It should be set by a function that calls
luaD_precall() and would be about to call luaD_poscall(),
but it will not get a chance to because the called function
yielded (either luaD_precall() &gt; L-&gt;top or luaV_execute()
returned NULL) and the function must return.
<p>
The CI_CALLING flag is set -
<p>
in lvm.c, during execution of OP_CALL and OP_TAILCALL, when
<DL>
<dt><dd>they call a C function that yields;
<dt><dd>

</DL>
in lvm.c, during execution of OP_CALL into a Lua function;
<p>
in lvm.c, during execution of opcodes which call a metamethod
<DL>
<dt><dd>to get a value, and the metamethod yields.
<dt><dd>(via the SETOBJ2S_YP macro, which also saves the PC.)
<dt><dd>

</DL>
in lvm.c, during execution of opcodes which call a metamethod
<DL>
<dt><dd>but don't need a value, and the metamethod yields.
<dt><dd>(via the YP macro which also saves the PC.)
<dt><dd>

</DL>
in lvm.c, during execution of OP_UNM, OP_EQ, OP_LE, OP_LT
<DL>
<dt><dd>opcodes which operate similarly but don't use macros.
<dt><dd>

</DL>
in lapi.c, when the C function calls lua_call_yp(), and the
<DL>
<dt><dd>called function yields. In this case, there is no PC
<dt><dd>to save; the C function is responsible for saving its
<dt><dd>own state. However, the stack pointer and the number
<dt><dd>of results requested from the lua_call_yp() are saved
<dt><dd>into the CallInfo<a href="/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=edit&amp;id=CallInfo" >?</a> so that the call can be completed
<dt><dd>in the future.
</DL>
<p>
<UL>
<li> Note that due to the change in luaD_precall (that it may go ahead and add as many CallInfo<a href="/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=edit&amp;id=CallInfo" >?</a>'s as it can onto the stack until it encounters a yield), the CI_CALLING flags should not be set using (L-&gt;ci-1) as was done previously. The CallInfo<a href="/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=edit&amp;id=CallInfo" >?</a> pointer must be saved _prior_ to calling luaD_precall.
</UL>
<p>
<UL>
<li> The nCcalls counter is no longer used to prohibit yields from occuring. Instead, the error from an invalid yield is generated by the API call that could not handle the yield. The nCcalls counter is still maintained; however, its value may not be that useful as it counts C functions that have been suspended (removed from the C stack); therefore it may not have any relevance to the size of the C stack.
</UL>
<p>
<p>
TODO:
<p>
<UL>
<li> Complete set of YP API functions:
</UL>
<pre>

  lua_gettable_yp()

  lua_settable_yp()

  etc

</pre>
<UL>
<li> Find some way to give C functions the ability to allocate stack space when they need to suspend?? That might be very difficult, as the next higher function has already come in on top of us. For now, C functions have to preallocate any stack space they might need.
