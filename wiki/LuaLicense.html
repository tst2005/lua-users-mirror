Currently this page is a critique of the Lua license.

Here is the text (or see <a href="http://www.lua.org/copyright.html">[original]</a>):

<p>
This license seems similar to the BSD license <a href="http://www.xfree86.org/3.3.6/COPYRIGHT2.html#5">[2]</a>.
<p>
While such a proprietary license is convenient for Tecgraf and PUC-Rio lawyers, it is not convenient for the free software community.  The open source and free software communities need software with well-known licenses so that when the inevitable questions arise like "can I use Lua in my GPL'd software?" one need only consult readily available information about license compatibility <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licenses/license-list.html">[3]</a>.
<p>
The statements "... this implementation have been entirely designed and written by...", and "this implementation contains no third-party code," which supposedly must be included in the license of all derived works, is also a problem.  Derived works obviously may include code not written by the Lua authors, or third-party code, causing these statements to be false.
<p>
<em>Note: the copyright date should be updated :-) The "This implementation contains no third-party code." note is also annoying because it can means that Lua cannot include code submitted by other contributors. At least, not by without a full rewritting by the authors... Indeed, the two lines about the implementation should be removable or we should be able to edit them as "The original implementation...".</em> --<a href="../wiki/PhilippeLhoste.html" >PhilippeLhoste</a> 
<p>
From Roberto's posting it seems that by "Lua implementation" they mean Lua itself and not the source code.  Certainly "implementation" was a bad choice of words.
