Descriptions or discussions of the structure/organization of this wiki as it currently is.  This is more descriptive than prescriptive.
<p>
<em>The title of this page, "<a href="../wiki/LuaAddons.html" >LuaAddons</a>", I think is not the most descriptive. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Add-on.html">[According to Wikipedia]</a> an "add-on" is more like a plugin, which for a language like Lua would be a module, which is listed on a separate page (<a href="../wiki/LibrariesAndBindings.html" >LibrariesAndBindings</a>).  The emphasis of this particular page seems more to be tools that can be used for Lua development.  You might specifically call many of these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_software_engineering.html">[CASE tools]</a>, mainly with the exception of the "Lua distributions" and "documentation" sections.  Documentation is not obviously an add-on, and neither may be distributions.  Note that <a href="../wiki/LuaPowerPatches.html" >LuaPowerPatches</a> is partly related to distributions (i.e. patched/modified/custom versions of Lua itself), so some grouping of those pages might be done. --<a href="../wiki/DavidManura.html" >DavidManura</a></em>
<p>
<DL>
<dt><dd>[<a href="../wiki/LuaAddons.html" >LuaAddons</a>] is for indexing "things for Lua users", including libraries, documentation, development tools, and distributions.  "Lua addons" is perhaps not the best term, but the intended meaning is clarified in the first sentence of this page, and it's easier to say than "things for Lua users".  --<a href="../wiki/JohnBelmonte.html" >JohnBelmonte</a>
</DL>
<p>
<DL>
<dt><dd>Think of these three fuzzily-bounded parts: the contents of this wiki (<a href="../wiki/LuaDirectory.html" >LuaDirectory</a>), external links regarding Lua proper (<a href="../wiki/LuaLinks.html" >LuaLinks</a>), and external links regarding everything else for Lua users (<a href="../wiki/LuaAddons.html" >LuaAddons</a>).  I think it's spelled out clearly enough in the 3rd paragraph introducing this page.  --<a href="../wiki/JohnBelmonte.html" >JohnBelmonte</a>
</DL>
<p>
<DL>
<dt><dd><em>I've long felt the distinction between internal and external links is artificial for organizational purposes.  Some things even exist both internally and externally (e.g. <a href="../wiki/MetaLua.html" >MetaLua</a> v.s. <a href="http://metalua.luaforge.net/">[Metalua]</a>).  I recently moved the language comparison section from <a href="../wiki/LuaLinks.html" >LuaLinks</a> into <a href="../wiki/LuaComparison.html" >LuaComparison</a> for example.  --<a href="../wiki/DavidManura.html" >DavidManura</a></em>

<p>
On the <a href="../wiki/HomePage.html" >HomePage</a>, how do Featured Pages differ from Starting Points?  For example, why is <a href="../wiki/LuaDirectory.html" >LuaDirectory</a> not a Featured Page? --<a href="../wiki/DavidManura.html" >DavidManura</a>
<DL>
<dt><dd><em>The starting points provide the major index pages of the wiki and the place to give feedback.  These are by definition general and would never be featured pages.</em>  --<a href="../wiki/JohnBelmonte.html" >JohnBelmonte</a>
</DL>
<p>
<DL>
<DL>
<dt><dd>I tend to feel that the contents of <a href="../wiki/LuaDirectory.html" >LuaDirectory</a> would be more useful on the home page, in some way, rather than as a subordinate link.  The current structure feels somewhat inverted and disorienting. --<a href="../wiki/DavidManura.html" >DavidManura</a>
</DL>
</DL>
<p>
Page names that would otherwise be a single word tend to be preceeded by "Lua" if appropriate, and only the first letter of an acronym is capitalized (e.g. <a href="../wiki/LuaFaq.html" >LuaFaq</a> not Faq or LuaFAQ).  There are exceptions, e.g. <a href="../wiki/LuaPowerPatches.html" >LuaPowerPatches</a> and <a href="../wiki/IoLanguage.html" >IoLanguage</a>.
<p>
users.lua.org may make more sense than lua-users.org, though this has been discussed here: <a href="http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2001-07/msg00208.html">http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2001-07/msg00208.html</a> .
<p>
<a href="../wiki/LibrariesAndBindings.html" >LibrariesAndBindings</a> and <a href="../wiki/LuaForge.html" >LuaForge</a> have some overlap in purpose.  <a href="../wiki/LuaForge.html" >LuaForge</a> is larger (contains 215 projects), though not all of the projects registered there are modules.  However, not all Lua projects are registered on <a href="../wiki/LuaForge.html" >LuaForge</a>.  Some projects are hybrids: registered on <a href="../wiki/LuaForge.html" >LuaForge</a> but with files stored elsewhere.  A few modules are just maintained informally on the wiki in the <a href="../wiki/SampleCode.html" >SampleCode</a> section.  Some modules are registered in the <a href="../wiki/LuaRocks.html" >LuaRocks</a> database.  There is no central place comparable to CPAN for registering modules.
<p>
<H2>Suggested Lua Wiki Guidelines</H2>
<p>
The following are recommendations or what I think are good practices for this wiki. --<a href="../wiki/DavidManura.html" >DavidManura</a>
<p>
(1) All code or pages should be marked with the Lua version it is intended to run on.
<p>
One example:
<p>
<DL>
<dt><dd><pre class="code">
<span class="comment">-- Compatible with Lua 5.1 (not 5.0).</span>

<span class="keyword">function</span> test(t)

  <span class="library">print</span>(t, # t)

<span class="keyword">end</span>

</pre>

</DL>
<p>
A problem in the past was that people added Lua 4 examples to the wiki.  Then Lua 5.0 followed by 5.1 came along, which often fails to recognize Lua 4 (and even sometimes Lua 5.0).  However, the Lua 4 code remained on the wiki, and there was no hint of this to the reader.  Asko agrees <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.lua.general/36436">[1]</a>.  Marking the version as such will do much to solve the problem.  In fact, this is already enforced on <a href="../wiki/LuaPowerPatches.html" >LuaPowerPatches</a>.  Also, if you find old code but don't have time at the moment to fit it, I recommend marking it with a <a href="../wiki/VersionNotice.html" >VersionNotice</a>.
<p>
Ideally, we'd want old Lua code on the wiki converted to the latest version of Lua.  Still, I think it is ok, maybe desirable, to keep the old version as a footnote for historical reference.  Just mark it as such.
<p>
(2) Proper syntax highlighting of interactive Lua sessions would be useful, as this occurs a lot on the wiki.  You can use regular "Lua" syntax highlighting, which usually works ok but not always:
<p>
<DL>
<dt><dd><pre class="code">
&gt; = <span class="string">"test if [["</span>

test <span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="string">[[

&gt; = "test]]</span>"

test]]

</pre>

</DL>
<p>
One version of the Perl code used by the wiki is at <a href="../wiki/LuaToHtml.html" >LuaToHtml</a>.  I'd like to offer a patch, but see comments there.
<p>
(3) Syntax highlighting for C.
<p>
This would help in the many C code examples.  Requested also by <a href="../wiki/RiciLake.html" >RiciLake</a> on <a href="../wiki/GuestBook.html" >GuestBook</a>.
<p>
(4) Style recommendations for authoring pages
<p>
Based on editing a lot of pages, these are what I think are good practices for authors and editors to follow.  Use the Lua syntax highlighting feature.  Indent code examples to the right (as done in the Lua examples above) to set them off from the surrounding text.  Avoid tabs, but rather use two spaces (or three), as follows the Lua Manual and PiL book style, and as I think is most suitable for the wiki medium.  Avoid extra spaces in expressions as in <code>x = f( x, y ) or { a , b </code>} but rather use <code>x = f(x, y) or {a, b</code>}--in general use the most conventional style consistent with other pages on the wiki.  Actually, I just found this: <a href="../wiki/SourceCodeFormatter.html" >SourceCodeFormatter</a>.
<p>
Some sets of pages are sufficiently similar in nature that they fall into certain classes, in which case some consistency can be imposed.  One such example is <a href="../wiki/SampleCode.html" >SampleCode</a>.  
<p>
(5) Structure of the wiki
<p>
Some past comments on the overall wiki structure are in <a href="../wiki/WikiStructure.html" >WikiStructure</a>, but I'm still forming an opinion about the overall structure, and for now a higher priority is a review most of the wiki content as noted below.
<p>
(6) Periodic review of content.
<p>
Content on the wiki should be periodically reviewed for quality assurance, consistency, and correctness of content.  As Lua changes and the Lua community changes, published content can become less correct over time (as in the Lua 4 case above shows).  I'm currently working on my own review of much of the wiki content.

The title of the former is overly general.  It provides a particular lexer using the re2c tool, and as such is only one of the many Lua lexers available in <a href="../wiki/LuaGrammar.html" >LuaGrammar</a>.

<li> <a href="../wiki/IndexIntervalFormatIssue.html" >IndexIntervalFormatIssue</a> could be better named.  This is closely related to <a href="../wiki/CountingFromOne.html" >CountingFromOne</a>, and these might be better merged into a single long page with sections.  <a href="../wiki/IndexIntervalFormatIssue.html" >IndexIntervalFormatIssue</a> is a logically written summary of some main points, though perhaps does not comprehensively summarize all points expressed in <a href="../wiki/CountingFromOne.html" >CountingFromOne</a>.

<dt><dd>I've invented a policy (and found it handy) to italicize links to all pages which contain directories, i.e. lists of links or submitted forms. It can be criticized though.

<dt><dd><em>I consider the terms <a href="../wiki/LuaProgramming.html" >LuaProgramming</a> and <a href="../wiki/LuaCoding.html" >LuaCoding</a> essentially synonymous (i.e. writing out source code).

The links on the <a href="../wiki/LuaCoding.html" >LuaCoding</a> page seems to deal more with the processes surrounding use and development of Lua code, basically the software engineering<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering.html">[2]</a> aspects, which may even be outside of the Lua language itself.

<DL>
<DL>
<dt><dd>As with previous restructurings like this, I can't say I'm in favor.  Things are getting too fragmented across pages, hierarchies are getting deeper, cross-referencing increasing.  This hits the weak points of wiki's, especially this simple wiki implementation.  Yes monolithic pages aren't perfect, but they have advantages:  less "places" (to become lost), less desire to start adding navigation aids everywhere, keeps a wider picture in one view, less need to repeat directory guidelines or policies (or omit them and deal with consequences).  There is something to be said for constraints (e.g. limiting hierarchies to 2 deep).  **  I don't agree with the use of italics for index page references-- it's a bit of an overuse of formatting for little gain.  Will I really decide to visit a link or not based on whether it's an index?  --<a href="../wiki/JohnBelmonte.html" >JohnBelmonte</a>

<dt><dd><em>I see reason in the proposed reorganization, though I do have some of the concerns of John.

</DL>
</DL>
<p>
<DL>
<DL>
<dt><dd><em>I also think, perhaps, as a rule that an index page that a user would not think of going to should not exist.  A typical user I think comes to the wiki to ask questions like "How do I define an object in Lua?" (solutions: <a href="../wiki/ObjectOrientedProgramming.html" >ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>), "How do I serialize an object?" (solutions: <a href="../wiki/TableSerialization.html" >TableSerialization</a>), "How should I structure modules?" (solutions: <a href="../wiki/ModuleDefinition.html" >ModuleDefinition</a>), "How do I do parallel programming?" (solutions: <a href="../wiki/MultiTasking.html" >MultiTasking</a>), "How do I bind non-Lua code to Lua?" (solutions: <a href="../wiki/BindingCodeToLua.html" >BindingCodeToLua</a>), "Where can I find a 'batteries included' build of Lua for my platform?" (solutions: <a href="../wiki/LuaDistributions.html" >LuaDistributions</a>), etc.  As seen, there can be one page that is fairly comprehensive and coherent on the topic.  Now for <a href="../wiki/LuaLanguage.html" >LuaLanguage</a>, the question is "I'm looking for a more detailed description of the Lua language beyond that in the Reference Manual.  Also show me various other random things under 'Enhancement Proposals and Third-party Modifications'."  For <a href="../wiki/LuaProgramming.html" >LuaProgramming</a>, the question is "How can I structure code to achieve a certain goal or improve quality?"  For <a href="../wiki/LuaCoding.html" >LuaCoding</a>, the question is "What tools and methods, outside of the Lua language itself, can I use to achieve a certain goal or improve quality (which is somehow different from <a href="../wiki/LuaAddons.html" >LuaAddons</a>)?"  For <a href="../wiki/LuaDomains.html" >LuaDomains</a>, the question is "Give me a topically categorized list of stuff."  Of the four pages I think <a href="../wiki/LuaProgramming.html" >LuaProgramming</a> (once called "Lua Fu") is the most coherent, and I considered extracting such a page myself.  In fact, it has some similarities in purpose to the Lua Programming Gems book.  If one wanted though, I think the <a href="../wiki/LuaLanguage.html" >LuaLanguage</a>, <a href="../wiki/LuaProgramming.html" >LuaProgramming</a>, and <a href="../wiki/LuaCoding.html" >LuaCoding</a> pages could be combined into a single page though perhaps maintain the same grouping.  This combined page would address how to effectively achieve goals.  Perhaps that page is <a href="../wiki/LuaDirectory.html" >LuaDirectory</a> though.  --<a href="../wiki/DavidManura.html" >DavidManura</a></em>

<DL>
<dt><dd><a href="../wiki/JohnBelmonte.html" >JohnBelmonte</a>, but wiki technology is not for <em>less</em> places, it's for <em>more</em> places. For not to become lost (both for reader to search/navigate and for editor to structure/maintain), people have invented categories. (Frankly speaking, all of this is mainly an effort to emulate Media<code></code>Wiki-like categories<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FAQ/Categorization.html">[3]</a>... Have you used them?). For not to repeating, people have invented templates. (Have you used them?) And I feel that trying to adapt the wiki structure to the wiki engine is not really a good idea. Instead, we should consider adapting the wiki engine to the wiki structure.
<dt><dd>The reason for italics. Wiki technology suggests that for navigation and observability purposes, every page should be listed at least in one category/directory/index. The italicization idea has been born from the need to mark what is considered as such categories.
<dt><dd>Cross-referencing inside the hierarchy is not a weak point. In fact, it is an essential feature of consistent categorization. Categories' hierarchy cannot be represented as a tree; it is a directed graph with no loops<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories#Categories_do_not_form_a_tree.html">[4]</a>.
<dt><dd>Limiting hierarchies to N depth levels for one page is a reasonable approach. Not to forcedly shallowing it on one page, but to extract deep branches to separate pages. (I would suggest the maximum depth of 4, to cut 5-level branch into e.g. 3- and 2-level parts). The depth of cross-page hierarchy should <em>not</em> be limited.
<dt><dd><a href="../wiki/DavidManura.html" >DavidManura</a>, 'Engineering' ~= 'Software Engineering'. For me, LuaEngineering<a href="/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=edit&amp;id=LuaEngineering" >?</a> reminds something like CAD/CAE systems (...somewhere in <a href="../wiki/LuaDomains.html" >LuaDomains</a>). --<a href="../wiki/DmitryGaivoronsky.html" >DmitryGaivoronsky</a>

<dt><dd>Yes I've used wiki categories on a wiki over 10 years ago.  You can even do it on a simple wiki like this by having several pages reference a category page and using the back-reference feature.  But when I started the lua-users wiki in 2001 I made a conscious effort <em>not</em> to introduce such complications and avoid many similar pitfalls of wiki confusion I had encountered in my experience.  I was quite familiar with feature-laden wiki engines at the time an in subsequent years.  Even starting with this simple engine, I spent a bit of effort pulling features out to keep things simple.  The task of organizing and categorizing things can be overdone, and the importance of content-- the real value-- lost.  The reorg you've undertaken since around the start of the year has gone against the grain of my conscious intentions for the site, but I don't want to be a dictator.  I value David's opinion as he's put a lot of care concerning content and organization into this wiki over the years, so I'd ask that you please consider his advice and feedback.  **  I think you misunderstand what I mean by limiting hierarchy level.  I'm referring to inter-page hierarchies, not heading hierarchies within a page.  In other words I want less pages, not more.  --<a href="../wiki/JohnBelmonte.html" >JohnBelmonte</a>

I feel <a href="../wiki/LearningLua.html" >LearningLua</a> and <a href="../wiki/LuaComparison.html" >LuaComparison</a> are significant enough to be featured too, though they are already prominent in <a href="../wiki/LuaFaq.html" >LuaFaq</a>.   --<a href="../wiki/DavidManura.html" >DavidManura</a></em>

<dt><dd>Logically, Introduction should belong to <a href="../wiki/LuaLanguage.html" >LuaLanguage</a>. I've leaved Introduction and Community at the top level mostly for convenience and to fill the space. They can be too small to deserve separate pages; but if you feel it more consistent this way, I don't mind.

<dt><dd>I suggest not to pickup any "important" or "featured" pages. It is very subjective matter. It should be realized that if lua-users be more popular, this would lead to wiki wars (filtering -&gt; reversions -&gt; censorship). After all, <a href="../wiki/LuaDirectory.html" >LuaDirectory</a> "is a top level directory of all Lua content at this wiki", and the <em>Featured pages</em> section is at the <a href="../wiki/HomePage.html" >HomePage</a>.
<dt><dd>Another choice would be to leave and gather at second level only italicised links (i.e. directories). It is a formal criterion which is pretty simple to maintain and pursue. (But can be too formal for comfortable use -- that's why in my original proposal I've permitted some exceptions.)
<dt><dd>It can be unclear, but... All of this is just attempts to invent something that is actually invented already. I am still hinting at Mediawiki-like categories (as russians say, "why we should try to invent a bicycle?"). --<a href="../wiki/DmitryGaivoronsky.html" >DmitryGaivoronsky</a>

<pre>The task of organizing and categorizing things can be overdone, and the importance of content-- the real value-- lost.</pre>  --<a href="../wiki/JohnBelmonte.html" >JohnBelmonte</a>
<DL>
<dt><dd>It is pretty hard to speak about any importance of content when most of it is buried underground. This wiki has really many pages, but many of them have pretty no chances to be viewed by average user. (I've found it more handy to leech all lua-users content at once with wget than read it following hyperlinks.) It is very hard to find anything in a heap of <em>unorganized</em> things (russian saying: "to search a needle in a rick of hay"). So, I believe the proper question is: Is the engine scalable for so many pages? (Can you prove that?) --<a href="../wiki/DmitryGaivoronsky.html" >DmitryGaivoronsky</a>

<dt><dd><a href="../wiki/DavidManura.html" >DavidManura</a>, we can merge <strong>Algorithms</strong> section from <a href="../wiki/LuaProgramming.html" >LuaProgramming</a> with <a href="../wiki/LuaDomains.html" >LuaDomains</a>.

Not all entries in <a href="../wiki/LuaDomains.html" >LuaDomains</a> are really Lua algorithms. (So, in formal terms, <a href="../wiki/LuaDomains.html" >LuaDomains</a> and LuaAlgorithms<a href="/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=edit&amp;id=LuaAlgorithms" >?</a> are parallel categories, while LuaAlgorithms<a href="/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=edit&amp;id=LuaAlgorithms" >?</a> is subcategory of <a href="../wiki/LuaProgramming.html" >LuaProgramming</a>.) --<a href="../wiki/DmitryGaivoronsky.html" >DmitryGaivoronsky</a>
