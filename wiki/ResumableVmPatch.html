This is a patch to make the Lua VM fully resumable. It solves most
of the practical problems with coroutines still present in
<a href="http://www.lua.org/versions.html#5.1">[Lua 5.1]</a>.
<p>
In particular, you can now:
<UL>
<li> Yield across all metamethods (except <code>__gc</code>).
<li> Yield across iterator functions (<code>for x in func</code>).
<li> Yield across callbacks (<code>table.foreach()</code>, <code>dofile()</code>, ...).
<li> Yield across protected callbacks (<code>pcall()</code>, <code>xpcall()</code>, ...).
<li> Yield from C functions and resume back to them.
</UL>
<p>
This is a new and <em>fully portable</em> approach to this problem. It combines
ideas from Eric Jacobs 'improved coroutines' patch and experiences gained
from working on my 'true C coroutines' patch. The changes to the Lua core
are as little intrusive as possible, owing to a flexible yield mechanism.
One side-effect is a faster <code>pcall()</code> and a slightly faster Lua VM in general.

<p>
Greg Falcon aka <a href="../wiki/VeLoSo.html" >VeLoSo</a> has offered to be the new maintainer of the patch.
Please direct all questions about the patch to him.
<p>
<em>I've decided to continue my work on a different approach to the yield-across-C problem. Please have a look at <a href="http://coco.luajit.org/">[Coco]</a>, too. Both approaches have their benefits and drawbacks. For more info search the <a href="http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/">[Lua mailing list archive]</a> for "Coco" and/or "RVM". -- <a href="../wiki/MikePall.html" >MikePall</a></em>
<p>
I second this.  <a href="http://coco.luajit.org/">[Coco]</a> has a good many benefits over this patch.  It is a much more elegant approach, it is better tested, it requires no modifications to your Lua C functions to make them resumable, it works on a great many platforms, and it is required for <a href="http://luajit.org/luajit.html">[LuaJIT 1.x]</a>.  Coco is probably the correct choice for your project if you need improved coroutine support.
<p>
That said, I think this patch is valuable because of its ANSI C approach, which allows it to work on all platforms where Lua builds, and which might help lead to a future Lua core with better coroutine behavior.  -- <a href="../wiki/VeLoSo.html" >VeLoSo</a>

Update 2006-04-16 <a href="../wiki/VeLoSo.html" >VeLoSo</a>: Patch against Lua 5.1 final.  No major changes.  I did remove some performance patches that did not further the goal of a resumable VM (for clarity's sake). I updated this patch for 5.1 with a good amount of care, though it's possible I may have missed some subtle point. Buyer beware.
<p>
Update 2005-05-24 <a href="../wiki/MikePall.html" >MikePall</a>: Patch against Lua 5.1-work6. No major functional changes,
but some internal reorganization. It's now possible get a traceback from
a dead coroutine (like in the baseline). The new operators in work6
(*s and a%b) are of course resumable, too.
<p>
A number of fixes for the Lua 5.1-work6 baseline have been included in the patch:
MSVC number2int fix, *s performance improvement, remove undefined
lua_checkpc assertion.
<p>
<p>
<H2>Compatibility</H2>
<p>
The Lua API has <strong>not</strong> been changed and there is <strong>no need</strong> to change
anything in existing Lua code. In particular you can now put code that
uses <code>pcall()</code> inside a coroutine and still yield from the protected
functions <em>without</em> any code change.
<p>
There is <strong>no need</strong> to change existing C code, too. But of course existing
functions are not fully resumable because the old C API did not provide
such a capability. This is <em>only</em> a concern if your C functions need
callbacks (<code>lua_call</code>) or protected calls (<code>lua_pcall</code>) <em>and</em> you want to
yield from the called functions.
<p>
There is a handful of new C API functions that allow you to make your C
functions resumable. The conversion is pretty straightforward. E.g. I had
to change only a couple of lines each to make the standard Lua library
functions resumable. See below for a tutorial.
<p>
<p>
<H2>How it Works</H2>
<p>
The changes to the Lua core are non-intrusive due to a special trick in the
new yield mechanism: Whenever there are intervening (but resumable) C call
boundaries, the yield mechanism just throws a 'yield error' to quickly
unfold the C stack. There is no need to check for a yield condition on
return of each and every function call all the way through the bottom of
the C stack.
<p>
This helps minimize the changes to the VM core and makes it easy to convert
over existing C functions. There is no performance impact on the standard
control flow (i.e. without yielding).
<p>
BTW: The yield throw mechanism is not used in the standard situation
of a <code>coroutine.yield()</code> to avoid the overhead of longjmp.
<p>
The protected call mechanism has been changed to avoid using a setjmp
wrapper whenever there is already such a wrapper in the C stack. Unwinding
the C stack and the Lua stack are now two separate concerns. This makes
<code>pcall()</code> as cheap as a function call: ~10-15% faster on x86 and even more
on CPUs with many registers, e.g. ~30% on IA64 (Itanium).
<p>
I've done quite a bit of instruction profiling and cache-miss profiling
and derived several tiny optimizations to the Lua core. E.g. coroutines
need ~10% less memory.
<p>
I fixed a few bugs/misfeatures, too:
<UL>
<li> An intermittent call to the 'call' hook when returning to a Lua function from <code>coroutine.yield()</code> has been removed.
<li> The Lua stack frame is no longer destroyed by <code>coroutine.resume()</code> when the count/line hook yields.
<li> The call/return hooks properly disable yielding.
<li> Dead coroutines can be safely recycled (only after ok return from <code>lua_resume</code>). But only from the C API right now (just push a new function and arguments on the stack and resurrect it with <code>lua_resume</code>).
</UL>
<p>
Note that the patch looks a bit lengthy due to many one-line changes
and some code that had to be moved around in ldo.c. Really,
there isn't that much new code except for the new stack unwind mechanism
and the VM opcode resume handling.
<p>
<p>
<H2>Lua API Extensions</H2>
<p>
There is only one new function:
<pre>

  epcall(err, f, arg1, arg2, ...)

</pre>
It is intended as a saner replacement for the odd <code>xpcall()</code> API that does
not allow you to pass arguments to a protected function when you want
to set an error handler, too. This implied that you needed to artificially
create closures for use with <code>xpcall()</code>. <code>epcall()</code> has no such restrictions.
<p>
<code>epcall()</code> behaves in every respect like <code>pcall()</code>, except that it sets an
error handler function to be called before the Lua stack is unwound
(like <code>xpcall()</code> does).
<p>
<code>xpcall()</code> is retained for compatibility only.
<p>
<p>
Another minor change is that you get a different error message when
a yield fails:
<p>
<UL>
<li> OLD: "attempt to yield across metamethod/C-call boundary"
<li> NEW: "attempt to yield across non-resumable call boundary"
</UL>
<p>
This better reflects the circumstances when this error happens now
(if at all).
<p>
<p>
<H2>C API Extensions</H2>
<p>
A new set of <code>lua_v*</code> and <code>lua_i*</code> functions augment <code>lua_call()</code>,
<code>lua_pcall()</code> and <code>lua_yield()</code>:
<pre>

  void   lua_call (lua_State *L, int nargs, int nresults);

| void  lua_vcall (lua_State *L, int nargs, int nresults, void *ctx);

| void  lua_icall (lua_State *L, int nargs, int nresults, int ictx);

  void  lua_pcall (lua_State *L, int nargs, int nresults, int ef);

| void lua_vpcall (lua_State *L, int nargs, int nresults, int ef, void *ctx);

| void lua_ipcall (lua_State *L, int nargs, int nresults, int ef, int ictx);

  int   lua_yield (lua_State *L, int nargs);

| int  lua_vyield (lua_State *L, int nargs, void *ctx);

| int  lua_iyield (lua_State *L, int nargs, int ictx);

</pre>
(Don't worry, most of these are just macros with proper casts.)
<p>
The new functions take a context argument (either a <code>void *</code> or an <code>int</code>)
which can be used to save the current state of the running C function.
Using these API functions with a non-NULL/non-zero context argument
indicates to the Lua core that your C function is resumable (i.e. the
callbacks are allowed to yield).
<p>
The classic non-resumable API functions <code>lua_call()</code>, <code>lua_pcall()</code> and
<code>lua_yield()</code> are just macros, passing a NULL context argument to the
<code>lua_v*</code> equivalents.
<p>
<p>
Two new API functions can be used to retrieve the context:
<pre>

| void *lua_vcontext (lua_State *L);

| int   lua_icontext (lua_State *L);

</pre>
On the first call of a C function the context is initialized to NULL/zero.
When a coroutine yields and is resumed again, a resumable C function
is simply called again. But this time the context is guaranteed to be
non-NULL/non-zero and reflects the saved state of the C function
(or the error number in case an error is caught by <code>lua_vpcall</code>/<code>lua_ipcall</code>).
<p>
<p>
You have to be aware that the C stack including your C function <em>may</em> be
unwound when you use the new API functions for callbacks. This can <em>only</em>
happen when the callback (or any function called from it) yields. In
this case the control flow never <em>returns</em> to your C function from the
new API call. Instead your C function will be <em>called</em> again when the
coroutine is resumed.
<p>
<p>
This means that you have to save all context your C function keeps.
Either by passing a specific context argument to the API call (a flag,
an index/counter or a pointer) and/or by saving the context on the
Lua stack (<em>before</em> making the API call). See below for a tutorial.
<p>
When a coroutine is resumed, any functions higher in the call stack are
completed before resuming (returning to) functions lower in the stack.
There are no restrictions on the use of the Lua value stack before or
after using any of the above API functions because there cannot be an
active function higher in the stack while a C function is executing
(unlike when it is suspended).
<p>
<p>
All <code>lua_*yield()</code> API functions are tail calls in the sense that you <strong>must</strong>
use them with a return statement, like this:
<pre>

  return lua_vyield(L, na, ctx);

</pre>
The call may or may not return to your C function before executing the
return statement, depending on whether the standard yield or the yield
throw mechanism is used. Do <strong>not</strong> attempt to outsmart this mechanism by
adding code between the yield call and the return statement. When the
context is NULL/zero (or <code>lua_yield</code> is used), your function will not
be called again (a tail yield). Otherwise it will be called again when
the coroutine is resumed.
<p>
<p>
<code>lua_vpcall</code>/<code>lua_ipcall</code> may fall back to the classic behaviour of creating
a setjmp wrapper on the C stack. This happens when no such wrapper exists
yet or when there is an intervening non-resumable call boundary in the
C stack (e.g. when used from hooks or from <code>__gc</code>). Of course the resulting
call stack is not resumable, but then it wasn't resumable before that,
anyway. You will hardly notice in practice because the standalone Lua
executable (<code>lua.c</code>) always wraps the main chunk with <code>lua_pcall()</code> and of
course <code>lua_resume()</code> creates a setjmp wrapper, too.
<p>
Another point to note about <code>lua_vpcall</code>/<code>lua_ipcall</code> (but not <code>lua_pcall</code>)
is that they <em>may</em> leave the callback function and its arguments on the
stack below the error message, in case of error (sorry, but this is very
difficult to solve in the Lua core). You have to be careful not to make
any assumptions about relative stack levels when the protected call fails.
Of course the error message is guaranteed to be in the topmost stack slot
(relative index -1) and anything below the callback function (absolute
index 1..(func-1)) is still intact, too.
<p>
<p>
I removed <code>lua_cpcall()</code> from the core and replaced it with a simple macro
using standard API calls. I suggest that it be deprecated because it's
redundant.
<p>
<p>
<H2>Tutorial: Keeping the Context</H2>
<p>
Here is a short tutorial showing the changes you need to make to your
C functions to make them resumable (changed/new marked with **/++).
<p>
<p>
<H3>EXAMPLE #1: Simple flag -- <code>table.foreach()</code>:</H3>
<pre>

    static int foreach (lua_State *L) {

++    if (lua_vcontext(L)) goto resume;

      luaL_checktype(L, 1, LUA_TTABLE);

      luaL_checktype(L, 2, LUA_TFUNCTION);

      lua_pushnil(L);  /* first key */

      for (;;) {

        if (lua_next(L, 1) == 0)

          return 0;

        lua_pushvalue(L, 2);  /* function */

        lua_pushvalue(L, -3);  /* key */

        lua_pushvalue(L, -3);  /* value */

**      lua_icall(L, 2, 1, 1);

++  resume:

        if (!lua_isnil(L, -1))

          return 1;

        lua_pop(L, 2);  /* remove value and result */

      }

    }

</pre>
Here everything needed to resume is already on the Lua stack (the
previous key). So replacing <code>lua_call()</code> with <code>lua_icall()</code> and setting a
simple flag (1) is all you need to do.
<p>
Also note that the <code>goto</code> can safely jump around the initial checks because
the stack contents are guaranteed to stay the same when your C function
is resumed. This omits redundant checks (e.g. the standard mechanism to
check userdata metatables is slow).
<p>
If you really, really hate <code>goto</code>s then of course you can use <code>if</code>/<code>switch</code>
constructs, too. But you have to realize that they obscure the 'standard'
control flow. This is one of the cases where it makes perfect sense to
use <code>goto</code>. And your compiler will print a big fat warning when you jump
into a loop and forget to fetch the loop counter from the context, too.
<p>
<p>
<H3>EXAMPLE #2: Loop counter -- <code>print()</code>:</H3>
<pre>

    static int luaB_print (lua_State *L) {

      int n = lua_gettop(L);  /* number of arguments */

**    int i = lua_icontext(L);

++    if (i) {

++      n -= 2;  /* compensate for tostring function and result */

++      goto resume;

++    }

      lua_getglobal(L, "tostring");

      for (i=1; i&lt;=n; i++) {

        const char *s;

        lua_pushvalue(L, -1);  /* function to be called */

        lua_pushvalue(L, i);   /* value to print */

**      lua_icall(L, 1, 1, i);

++  resume:

        s = lua_tostring(L, -1);  /* get result */

        if (s == NULL)

          return luaL_error(L, "`tostring' must return a string to `print'");

        if (i&gt;1) fputs("\t", stdout);

        fputs(s, stdout);

        lua_pop(L, 1);  /* pop result */

      }

      fputs("\n", stdout);

      return 0;

    }

</pre>
Here we simply store the loop counter in the context. You need to be
careful to use only non-zero indexes because a zero context argument
marks a non-resumable call (and could not be distinguished from the
initial call, anyway).
<p>
The stack level may change during the execution of the function and this
can lead to a number of problems on resumption. Either keep it at a fixed
level (you can ensure this with <code>lua_settop()</code>) or use only relative indexes
<p>
or compensate for it after retrieving the context (see above).
<p>
<p>
<H3>EXAMPLE #3: Protected calls -- <code>pcall()</code>:</H3>
<pre>

    static int luaB_pcall (lua_State *L) {

++    int status = lua_icontext(L);

++    if (status) goto resume;

      luaL_checkany(L, 1);

**    status = lua_ipcall(L, lua_gettop(L) - 1, LUA_MULTRET, 0, -1);

++  resume:

~~    if (status &gt; 0) {  /* error */

~~      lua_pushboolean(L, 0);

~~      lua_insert(L, -2);  /* args may be left on stack with vpcall/ipcall */

~~      return 2;  /* return status + error */

~~    }

~~    else {  /* ok */

~~      lua_pushboolean(L, 1);

~~      lua_insert(L, 1);

~~      return lua_gettop(L);  /* return status + all results */

~~    }

~~  }

</pre>
There are four cases that can happen with <code>lua_vpcall</code>/<code>lua_ipcall</code>:
<p>
<UL>
<li> return with   status == 0:    no yield, callback ok
<li> return with   status == err:  no yield, callback throws error
<li> resume with  context == ctx:  yielded,  callback ok
<li> resume with icontext == err:  yielded,  callback throws error
</UL>
<p>
Unless you need the context argument for your own purposes (avoid the
range for the error numbers though), you can simply set the context to -1
and assign it to the status on resume. This allows for a simple check
for <code>&gt; 0</code> (error) or <code>&lt;= 0</code> (ok). You cannot use zero because this marks
a non-resumable pcall.
<p>
The above code works around the fact that <code>lua_vpcall</code>/<code>lua_ipcall</code> <strong>may</strong>
leave the call function and its arguments on the stack (but only when
an error is thrown during call setup). It's easier to explicitly code
the two possible outcomes than using inline conditionals (as before).
<p>
<p>
<H3>EXAMPLE #4: Userdata pointer:</H3>
<pre>

    typedef struct { ... } mytype_t;



    static int my_userdata_method (lua_State *L) {

      mytype_t *ud = (mytype_t *)lua_vcontext(L);

++    if (ud) goto resume;

      ud = (mytype_t *)luaL_checkudata(L, 1, MYTYPE_HANDLE);

      if (ud == NULL) ... /* error handling */

      ... /* check other args here */



      ... /* start processing */

      ... /* be sure to save all context in the userdata structure */

**    lua_vcall(L, na, nr, ud);  /* pass userdata as context */

++  resume:

      ... /* continue processing */

    }

</pre>
This is a typical example of a userdata method. Most of the time you can
store all needed context in the userdata and just use the userdata pointer
itself as a context argument. Of course the userdata is still on the stack
(it must be or it may be garbage collected), so you could just retrieve
the pointer again. But that would be slower and the context argument is
already there, so why not make good use of it?
<p>
Userdata methods are a perfect example for <code>lua_vyield()</code>, too:
<pre>

      while (read_operation(ud, ...) == BLOCKING) {

        ... /* do any processing needed after a blocking indication */

**      return lua_vyield(L, na, ud);

++  resume:

        ... /* do any processing needed resuming the read */

      }

</pre>
Here a potentially blocking I/O operation is attempted. Instead of
blocking, the operation returns a special status flag (BLOCKING).
This allows you to save the context and yield (e.g. back to a coroutine
scheduler), avoiding to block on the I/O operation. When the function
is resumed, you just retry, continue or finish the I/O operation. This
needs to be done in a loop if the I/O operation may block repeatedly.
<p>
<p>
<H3>EXAMPLE #5a: State machine with <code>switch</code>:</H3>
<pre>

    static int myfunction (lua_State *L) {

++    int state = lua_icontext(L);

++    switch (state) {

++    case 0:  /* initial call */

        ...

**      lua_vcall(L, na, nr, 1);

++    case 1:

        ...

**      lua_vcall(L, na, nr, 2);

++    case 2:

        ...

**      lua_vcall(L, na, nr, 3);

++    case 3:

        ...

        return n;

      }

    }

</pre>
Sometimes you need to use a bunch of callbacks or yields interspersed
in linear control flow. Here it may be beneficial to use a state machine
and save the current state (the position in the control flow) in the
context. You can assign the states by hand for simple needs (as shown above,
but probably with defines instead of numbers). For more complex needs you
could use macros or even a precompiler (written in Lua, of course?) to
generate the state machine automatically from your code.
<p>
<p>
<H3>EXAMPLE #5b: State machine with <code>goto</code>:</H3>
<p>
If you are using GCC you will be delighted to hear that it has a very useful
(but non-standard) extension called <em>labels as values</em> aka <em>computed goto</em>.
Read more about in the GCC info docs.
<p>
This is best combined with the local label extension inside a macro. Here
is the above example converted to use this feature (cleaner and quite a bit
faster, too):
<pre>

++  #define rvcall(L, na, nr) \

++    ({ __label__ RR; lua_vcall(L, (na), (nr), &amp;&amp;RR); RR: ; })



    static int myfunction (lua_State *L) {

++    void *cont = lua_vcontext(L);

++    if (cont) goto *cont;

      ...

**    rvcall(L, na, nr);

      ...

**    rvcall(L, na, nr);

      ...

**    rvcall(L, na, nr);

      ...

      return n;

    }

</pre>
<p>
<H2>To Yield or Not To Yield</H2>
<p>
Here is table showing you exactly where your code can yield and where it cannot.
<p>
Note that most of the remaining "no's" are irrelevant in practice.
<pre>

Yield across ...  | Yield from ...         | Ok? | Rationale

------------------+------------------------+-----+---------------------------

for x in func     | iterator function      | Yes |

VM operations     | metamethod except __gc | Yes |

(anywhere)        | __gc metamethod        | No  | Difficult, rarely useful

(anywhere)        | count/line hook        | Yes | Only via C API hooks

(anywhere)        | call/return hooks      | No  | Does anyone need this?

error processing  | err. handler/traceback | No  | Not very useful

(*) There is no need. Just call the metamethod with <code>lua_vcall</code>/<code>lua_icall</code>.
Or perform these kinds of operations with Lua code (always resumable).
<p>
<p>
<H2>TODO</H2>
<p>
<UL>
<li> Make coroutines first class citizens by making them callable (without a closure wrapper). There is no need for an artificial distinction between functions and coroutines, anyway (except at lower layers).
</UL>
<p>
<UL>
<li> A way to resume a coroutine and immediately throw an error. This can be used to involuntarily stop a coroutine and still give it a chance to clean up its state and resources with a pcall wrapper. This is useful for timeouts and related stuff and avoids having special case code in every yielding function. An extension to the C API is straightforward (a 10 line change to give <code>lua_resume(L, -1)</code> a meaning). But I still have no idea for a nice Lua API other than introducing a new <code>coroutine.eresume(co, err)</code> function.
</UL>
<p>
<UL>
<li> Fix <code>debug.sethook()</code> inheritance with coroutines. The C hook function and the hook mask is already inherited. But the current implementation does not realize this and does not copy the Lua hook function (stored in a special table anchored at the registry).
</UL>
<p>
<UL>
<li> Hooks for yield/resume events. No way to catch all cases right now with other hooks.
</UL>
<p>
<UL>
<li> Hooks for throw/catch events. Required for a full blown debugger.
</UL>
<p>
<UL>
<li> Document that C hook functions must not call <code>lua_gettable</code>/<code>lua_settable</code> with objects that have metamethods. Otherwise the PC of the Lua function is destroyed. It is advised to wrap any such activity inside a function called with <code>lua_call()</code> (where this is perfectly ok) or to use <code>lua_rawget</code>/<code>lua_rawset</code> instead. (This affects all Lua 5.1-work versions and is not due to my patch.)
</UL>
<p>
<UL>
<li> Document that compiling the Lua core with C++ exceptions makes throwing   errors <strong>dead slow</strong>. In fact there is no need to compile the core with C++ at all. No matter how you compile it, it provides a C API only. And you ought to catch <em>all</em> C++ exceptions in your own module code, anyway. At least now you get a proper error message if you forget to do so.
</UL>
<p>
<UL>
<li> Remove some int=&gt;void*=&gt;int casts that can generate undefined ANSI C behavior.
</UL>
