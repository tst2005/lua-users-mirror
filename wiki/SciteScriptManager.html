<H3>Why Create a New Script Manager?</H3>
Before you get the wrong idea, Script Manager was not created to eliminate Steve Donovan's extman.  If you've never used <a href="../wiki/SciteExtMan.html" >SciteExtMan</a> before, it is strongly recommended that you check it out.  Without it, this file wouldn't exist.  Script Manager was created to expand on extman's ideas by adding different elements and functions.  In addition, Script Manager was made to be a very user-friendly and smart script manager.
<p>
Here are the lastest versions of Script Manager's files:
<UL>
<li> Code: <a href="/files/wiki_insecure/editors/SciTE/ScriptManager.lua">Files:wiki_insecure/editors/SciTE/ScriptManager.lua</a>
<li> Documentation: <a href="/files/wiki_insecure/editors/SciTE/ScriptManagerDoc.html">Files:wiki_insecure/editors/SciTE/ScriptManagerDoc.html</a>
<li> Code, Documentation, and Useful Scripts: <a href="/files/wiki_insecure/editors/SciTE/ScriptManager.zip">Files:wiki_insecure/editors/SciTE/ScriptManager.zip</a>
</UL>
<p>
<H3>Script Manager Compatibility</H3>
Like extman, Script Manager is a lua script manager for SciTE.  It enables multiple scripts to capture standard and custom events without interfering with other scripts.  Script Manager was created with SciTE v1.75 on Windows ME <em>and I hate it, especially because I can't update to SciTE v1.76</em>.  Before you use Script Manager, you need to know what it is and is not compatible with:
<UL>
<li> Script Manager is available on Windows, but not on GTK (unfortunately, I don't have access to GTK, but I would be happy to make it compatible if I had the proper documentation or help).
<li> Script Manager doesn't use <a href="../wiki/SciteOther.html" >SciteOther</a> (I was never able to get it to work...Windows ME).
<li> Script Manager is fully compatible with extman (unless the script uses <code>scite_WordAtPos</code>, but that's easy to implement).
</UL>
<p>
<H3>Installation</H3>
Script Manager is just as easy to install as extman.  Just set the <em>ext.lua.startup.script</em> to the manager file (<code>ScriptManager.lua</code>).  Like extman, a specific directory can be set, except now the property is <em>ext.lua.script.directory</em>.  If you have any questions about Script Manager, just look in the documentation, it has just about everything you need to know about Script Manager.
<p>
<H3>Example Scripts</H3>
The example scripts in the 'Manager Hooks' directory are not explained in the documentation.  You will notice that the scripts (minus 1) from extman are not included; because they are compatible, you can just move them over if you need them.  Although they are explained within the files themselves, here is a little information about the scripts:
<UL>
<li> <code>AutoComplete+.lua</code>: this script enables users to easily change the size of the autocomplete window, and add pixmaps for autocompletion.  The properties can be different in separate lexers.
<li> <code>CallTip+.lua</code>: this script allows users to change the colors used in the calltip window, these settings can be different in different lexers too.
<li> <code>DisableAltF4</code>.lua: simply, this script disables the Alt+F4 key combination.
<li> <code>FastFiles.lua</code>: large files can run slow, the script speeds them up.
<li> <code>FoldSymbols+.lua</code>: this script allows users to create and use their own folding symbols.
<li> <code>QuickOutput.lua</code>: this script enables the user to quickly close and/or clear the output window.
<li> <code>SelectStyle.lua</code>: you should already know by the title, however, this script still makes it possible to select text normally.
<li> <code>UpdateStatusBar.lua</code>: again, obvious, but this allows the time and date to be shown correctly without switching files or saving.
</UL>
<p>
<H3>Suggestions, Comments, Help</H3>
I am open to suggestions and comments, along with the help for GTK compatibility and <code>SciteOther</code>.  So, if you have anything to say about Script Manager or you have any problems, post them here:
