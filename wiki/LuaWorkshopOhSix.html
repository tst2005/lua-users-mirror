<hr><H3>Where</H3>
<p>
The Lua Workshop 2006 will take place at the R&amp;D site <a href="http://www.tema-ingenieurs.nl/referenties/rdgebouwoce/">[1]</a>
of Oc&eacute; <a href="http://www.oce.com/">[2]</a> in Venlo, the Netherlands.  Venlo is a small city in the south-east of the country close to the German border.
<p>
Address information for the R&amp;D site:

</pre>
<p>
<H3>When</H3>
<p>
Monday 4 and Tuesday 5 September 2006.
<p>
<H3>How to get there</H3>
<p>
The nearest international airport is D&uuml;sseldorf, Germany, about 60km (38mi) away.  Schiphol airport in Amsterdam is about 185km (116mi) away.  For European flights you can also consider Eindhoven airport, which is about 64km (40mi) away.  Amsterdam and Eindhoven have an excellent train connection to Venlo (Schiphol has its own train station, Eindhoven station can be reached by taxi or bus.)  There is no direct connection from D&uuml;sseldorf to Venlo by train.
<p>
I will investigate the possibility to arrange a taxi bus service to D&uuml;sseldorf.  This requires that a larger group would make use of such a service.  If you intend to travel via D&uuml;sseldorf, could you please mail me (Wim Couwenberg <a href="mailto:wim.couwenberg:at:oce.com?subject=LuaOhSix">[3]</a>) your expected time of arrival?  It will help me to try to organise a taxi service.
<p>
There is a bus stop right in front of the R&amp;D building.
<p>
<H3>Where to stay</H3>
<p>
There are a couple of decent and reasonably priced hotels at walking distance from Oc&eacute;.  (Motel Venlo and Campanile Hotel Venlo.)  I will try to arrange a special company discount.  For that I'll need an estimate of the number of people that plan to stay there, so maybe you could mail me <a href="mailto:wim.couwenberg:at:oce.com?subject=LuaOhSix">[3]</a> if you do.  Depending on your budget and means of transportation, there are alternatives of course.

<H3>Joint Travel</H3>
<p>
<a href="../wiki/DanielSilverstone.html" >DanielSilverstone</a> and RobKendrick<a href="/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=edit&amp;id=RobKendrick" >?</a> will be travelling from Manchester to Venlo by car on the Saturday (2nd) and Sunday (3rd) of September. They intend to return to the UK after a day or two of travel in Europe after the conference. In theory they have a space or two in their car and would be willing to entertain the idea of a travelling companion were someone interested. If you think you might be interested (sharing fuel and ferry costs) then please contact Daniel by emailing him at dsilvers@digital-scurf.org
<p>
Andreas Stenius will be driving between Amsterdam and Venlo, 3rd and 5th of september (ca 20.00 in Amsterdam, both ways).
Anyone else flying to/from Schiphol and would like to get a ride to Venlo can contact him andreas at boxcom fullstop se.
