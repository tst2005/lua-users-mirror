Instead of giant custom clients and huge downloads,
Metaplace lets you play the same game on any platform that
reads its open client standard.
It supplies a suite of tools so you can make worlds,
and it hosts servers for you so that anyone can connect and play.
And the client could be anywhere on the Web.
<p>
Metaplace committed to an open markup standard for its network protocol
- anyone can write a client for any platform they want.
It uses Web standards for everything it could,
which is why you can have a game world that is also a website,
or use Web data to populate your world.

pbLua is an implementation of Lua 5.1 for the LEGO Mindstorms NXT. It is based on the open-source code for the NXT brick provided by LEGO. The low level drivers were modified slightly and then integrated with the Lua sources.
pbLua is an alternative text-based programming environment for the NXT that supports coroutines, strings, tables, and limited floating point operations.
The NXT is based on the ARM7 micro with 256K of FLASH and 64K of RAM. pbLua looks like a serial port to a PC and connects via USB. It is completely self contained as it runs the parser right on the brick.
Eventually, we'll support the Mac and Linux platforms when we figure out how USB gets enumerated on those platforms.

Lua 4.0 was integrated into the system that is used to monitor gas concentration levels during Space Shuttle launch operations. Launch personnel use Lua to perform some of the more tedious tasks such as long duration leak testing and statistical data collection. Lua was integrated into the Windows application that provides remote control of leak detection equipment installed at the launch pad. The remote control application provides hooks into Lua that allow a Lua script to gain access to the data collected and to issue commands to the leak detection equipment.
Lua was chosen mainly because it is an easy language to understand (a benefit for the launch personnel) and it is very easy to integrate into a project.

all non-player characters, platforms, puzzle pieces. Basically the game

<em>The Moving Picture Company</em>
<p>
Giggle is a renderman procedural DSO developed for the production of visual effects created for the film 'Troy'. This project required the rendering of scenes comprising tens of thousands of battling soldiers,in addition to complex city layouts and particle effects for flames, smoke and dust. The generation of all this geometry was handled almost exclusively at rendertime by Giggle.
<p>
Giggle's core functionality comprises approximately 40,000 lines of C++, written by 2 MPC programmers over the course of 9 months. This provides many capabilities including :
* loading of geometry, shaders, particle caches and a proprietary cache format for agent simulations.
* skinning and other geometry modifiers
* procedural geometry generation
* kd tree classes for space partitioning
* geometry evaluators to perform ray intersections and closest point queries
<p>
The functionality is bound into Lua, providing a flexible scripting interface which allows it to be easily adapted to specific tasks. MPC initially chose Lua for its reputation for speed and efficiency as well as for the great simplicity of its API. It has subsequently proved itself through heavy use by a team of 16 or so CG artists and across a renderfarm of over 500 machines.
<p>
Since adoption, Giggle's use has been extended to other MPC feature pipelines, and coupled with an interactive interpreter and OpenGL preview renderer to provide interactive script development and debugging.

and has been developed by a team of 3 to 7 programmers during its lifetime.
The production team totals 30.
<p>
Publique uses a modified version of
<a href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/cgilua/">[CGILua]</a>
as its current web engine and consists in almost 50K lines of Lua
and 5K line of C (not including CGILua itself).
<p>
Lua has been chosen for its ease of prototyping,
speed of execution and extensibility.
It is used for almost every feature in the system other than the OS Platform,
DBMS and Web Server abstraction layers.

<em>Multi Theft Auto</em>
<p>
Multi Theft Auto (MTA) is a multi-player modification for Rockstar North's Grand Theft Auto game series.
Originally founded back in early 2003 as an experimental piece of software, Multi Theft Auto has since grown into an advanced multiplayer platform for gamers and third-party developers.
Starting with MTA for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, you can play Grand Theft Auto on-line with your friends, in your own custom created maps and gamemodes, powered by the Lua scripting language and currently (as of end 2006) 373 game specific Lua functions!
The use of Lua allows you to create virtually any gamemode or feature you like in the game. Examples and other cool Lua stuff can be found at our homepage.

It is best used for jobs with simple configurations.
SciTE features a lot of modern editor features
(most provided by Scintilla)
like syntax highlighting of code,
call tips, autocompletion of code, folding, etc.
Since version 1.60,
Lua can be used to perform operations on the current buffer,

Auto<code></code>Play Media Studio is a unique software tool which allows you to quickly create your own custom Windows software, autoplay/autorun CD/DVD ROMs, and interactive multimedia presentations. Simply drag and drop rich media content such as photos, video, audio, Macromedia Flash content, text, HTML, and more directly into your project.
You can tie it all together with a powerful freeform scripting engine based on the popular Lua language. This easy-to-understand scripting language features everything from "for, repeat and while" loops, to "if/else" conditions, functions, variables and tables (associative arrays). We've included a library of 350+ powerful actions (high level functions) along with built-in mathematical and Boolean evaluation. The point-and-click "Action Wizard" and "Code Wizard" make is easy enough that even complete novices can add powerful interactivity to their projects. Advanced developers will appreciate the color syntax highlighting, code completion, function highlighting, as-you-type action prototypes and Ctrl+Space function listings. Auto<code></code>Play Media Studio Personal Edition is a free non-commercial version of Auto<code></code>Play Media Studio.

<em>Eagle Dynamics</em>
<p>
"DCS: Black Shark" is a PC flight simulator of the Russian Ka-50 attack helicopter and is the first title in a new Eagle Dynamics and The Fighter Collection simulation series: "Digital Combat Simulator" (DCS). Following Eagle Dynamics' tradition of excellence, "DCS: Black Shark" will bring an even more realistic simulation experience than its predecessor "Flaming Cliffs". "DCS: Black Shark" will offer an unprecedented level of realism in regards to flight dynamics, instruments modeling, avionics systems, and weapon systems. The artificial Intelligence of ground vehicles and helicopters has been improved dramatically as well as weapon modeling. A new Mission Editor includes a powerful electronic mapping system that allows user to easily create missions and campaigns. A new campaign system allows the front line of the battlefield to move back and fourth according to your mission success or failure. Due to the increased flexibility of the DCS system, additional fixed-wing aircraft and helicopter add-ons will follow shortly.
<p>
Lua is heavily used through whole project for game AI programming, configuration purposes and many more. Game Mission Editor is nearly completely implemented on Lua.
