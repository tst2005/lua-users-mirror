This is an experimental patch against Lua 5.1-work6 to add support
for "fast strings" to the Lua VM.
<p>
It's based on an idea by Rici Lake (briefly mentioned in the
'Lua strings as "atoms"' mailing list thread in May 2005). It was
further discussed and refined on irc #lua. I decided to do a
prototype implementation to test the validity of the concept.
<p>
This patch is intended to gain feedback on the usefulness of fast
strings for Lua applications. Any and all comments are welcome.
Especially needed are benchmark comparisons for real applications
that use many (different) small strings. Thank you!
<p>
To avoid any misunderstanding: the patch is *NOT* intended to be
merged into the Lua 5.1 standard distribution nor would I
recommend to do so (at this time). I leave it entirely up to the
judgement of the Lua authors whether anything from this patch 
is worthwhile to be included into any future Lua version.
<p>
Please send your comments to the Lua mailing list, since the Wiki
is not well suited for discussions.

A number of fixes for the baseline have been included in the patch:
MSVC number2int fix, *s performance improvement, remove undefined
lua_checkpc assertion.
<p>
<H2>The Idea</H2>
<p>
Lua stores all objects in tagged value slots on the Lua stack or
in Lua tables. These slots are usually 12 or 16 bytes long
(depending on the architecture and the type of lua_Number).
The size is dominated by the requirement to store properly aligned
pointers and lua_Number's. The tag itself is a small integer and
easily fits into a single byte. That leaves us either 11 or 15
bytes of free space that can be put to good use.
<p>
The basic idea is to store fast strings (i.e. short strings of
up to 11 or 15 bytes) directly into tagged value slots instead
of allocating them on the heap.
<p>
This means that fast strings behave more like numbers in that
they do not need to be allocated, garbage collected or freed.
This significantly reduces VM overhead.
<p>
<H2>Compatibility</H2>
<p>
Neither the Lua API not the Lua/C API have been changed. There
is no need to change anything in your Lua or C modules (but see
below under "Caveats" for some notes about Lua/C API conformance).
<p>
Fast strings behave and look exactly like regular strings outside
the Lua core. You do not need any special provisions for using
them and there is no externally visible difference.
<p>
Yes, this means type() returns "string" and lua_type() returns
LUA_TSTRING, no matter how the string is stored internally.
You can use all Lua functions and all Lua/C API functions for
strings without restrictions.
<p>
Of course your application may be faster and it may use less
memory. So you may notice a difference after all. But that's
kind of the point of this patch ...
<p>
<H2>Rationale</H2>
<p>
Many applications use short strings extensively. It's well known
that there is a significant skew towards short strings in the
distribution of string sizes used by typical applications
(e.g. names, tags, identifiers, natural language words, ...).
And many of these short strings have only a very limited lifetime
(e.g. temporaries, used only in local scopes).
<p>
As a consequence, short strings usually incur a high overhead
for memory management (allocate and free), for garbage collection
(mark and sweep) and for managing a shared string hash table.
There is additional overhead due to contention with other managed
objects:
<UL>
<li> Allocating and freeing many small blocks interspersed with a few large blocks in more or less random order is the worst case for most memory allocators.
<li> Garbage collection algorithms usually scale with the number of collectible objects and not the total size of all objects.
<li> With a shared string hash table every created string object needs to be hashed at least once.
</UL>
<p>
Fast strings avoid most of this overhead:
<UL>
<li> Creation of a fast string is as simple as copying a few bytes to a stack slot and setting the tag.
<li> Deletion is implicit -- the stack slot is simply reused by overwriting it with some other object.
<li> Hashing is only needed for table keys. It's not required for table values nor for fast strings that never leave the stack.
<li> The garbage collector treats fast strings as incollectible and simply ignores them. There is no overhead for marking or sweeping fast strings.
<li> Contention of the shared string table is significantly reduced because the hash table is no longer swamped with many short strings.
</UL>
<p>
Two key advantages of a shared string table are that string
equality and table lookup are cheap. The former needs a type
plus pointer comparison, the latter can reuse the precomputed
hash value (but it needs to be stored with the allocated string).
<p>
Equality checks on fast strings are equally cheap when done
right: bulk comparison of a tagged value slot is fast and tag
number comparison can be optimized, too (e.g. by holding the
fast string length). Fast string hashing can use a fast bulk
hash of the whole slot. Any remaining hash overhead can be
reduced by avoiding the hash generation for lookups in small
tables (a linear bulk comparison is faster).
<p>
<H2>Benchmarks</H2>
<p>
Obviously one can prove almost anything when selecting the proper
benchmark. So I left out some targetted benchmarks like:
<code>lua -e 'for i in io.lines() do end' &lt;/usr/share/dict/words</code>
or excessive use of <code>string.gfind()</code> or <code>string.gsub()</code>.
<p>
These show tremendous speedups (anywhere from +60% to +200%
depending on the architecture), but probably do not exercise
typical application behaviour.
<p>
On the converse you won't see any difference on standard
benchmarks that do not use short strings extensively (e.g.
fibionacci numbers or matrix multiplication).
<p>
So I've just taken the obvious candidates from the "great
computer language shootout" benchmarks and compared them on
different architectures:
<pre>

Benchmark   |   x86      x64     PPC32    PPC64

------------+----------------------------------

hash        | +38.2%   +55.8%   +40.9%   +38.7%

spellcheck  | +23.6%   +45.8%   +17.7%   +25.2%

reversefile |  +6.2%   +22.7%   +10.2%   +13.6%

wordfreq    |  +2.2%    +8.3%   +10.6%    +8.6%   

</pre>
Well ... not bad, huh?
<p>
But of course it would be best to see some benchmark results
from real applications. Please share any insights you may have
with the mailing list. Thank you!
<p>
<H2>Restrictions</H2>
<p>
<UL>
<li> This patch has only been tested on 32 bit and 64 bit systems.
</UL>
<p>
16 bit systems are not supported right now and you'll get a
compiler error if you try. This is more a matter of testing
and supporting 16 bit size_t's (note that some 16 bit systems
use 32 bit size_t's, but the current implementation is not
tuned for this and refuses to compile on any 16 bit system).
<p>
<UL>
<li> It has only been tested with the standard lua_Number type (double). I do not expect problems with other types (this may affect the size and alignment of tagged value slots).
</UL>
<p>
<UL>
<li> The prototype implementation uses a fixed stack size (see LUAI_FIXEDSTACK in luaconf.h). This is only a simple workaround right now (see below). You may need to tweak this value if you have many coroutines or need deeply nested recursive functions.
</UL>
<p>
<H2>Implementation Details</H2>
<p>
One important requirement for the implementation of fast strings
was to not change the Lua/C API. This avoids the necessity to
rewrite any C modules and helps with getting quick feedback
for the prototype implementation.
<p>
However fast strings and regular strings need to coexist inside
the Lua core and must be treated differently almost everywhere.
But there should not be any visible difference between them
from the outside and they should be treated the same. This
necessitated a split between internal and external tag numbers.
<p>
Internal tag numbers are only visible inside the Lua core and
are stored in all tagged value slots (stack and table slots)
and GC objects. External tag numbers are only visible outside
of the Lua/C API and are used by all C modules.
<p>
The internal tag numbers are defined in lobject.h. All of their
names start with 'TT' (e.g. TTNIL, TTBOOLEAN, ...). They are
stored in a single unsigned byte (tt in struct TValue). The
tag number is split into a 4 bit major number and a 4 bit
minor number. The major number holds the basic object type,
the minor number holds additional details. The minor number
is currently only used for booleans (to hold false (0)
or true (1)) and fast strings (to hold the string length).
<p>
At the Lua/C API boundary all internal tag numbers are mapped
to the external tag numbers defined in lua.h. Their names start
with 'LUA_T' (E.g. LUA_TNIL, LUA_TBOOLEAN, ...) and keep the
same meaning as in a standard Lua core. Both fast strings and
regular strings map to the same external type (LUA_TSTRING).
The same API calls work with both kinds of strings and well
written C modules will never notice any difference (but see
below under "Caveats").
<p>
Clever allocation of internal tag numbers helps to speed up many
common checks. E.g. ttixstring() checks for both kinds of strings
in one operation and with only one conditional. Dito for the
performance sensitive l_isfalse() macro. The tag number for a
fast string of maximum length is always zero (0x00) and serves as
a terminator for C strings, too. This means that lua_tolstring()
can simply return a pointer to the stack slot for fast strings.
<p>
Due to the string pointer stability guarantees given by the
existing Lua/C API (see below) it's required to avoid stack
reallocation. For the prototype implementation I decided to use
a fixed stack size (see LUAI_FIXEDSTACK in luaconf.h). This is
of course not desirable in the long term and several better
solutions exist: stack chunking, lazy stack copying/freeing or
changing/augmenting the the Lua/C API guarantees. However this
was just not within the scope of this prototype implementation
(sorry).
<p>
Apart from the changes needed for the internal type system, all
places where strings are created or accessed needed to be changed
to handle both variants. This is what the ttixstring(), xsvalue()
and xslen() macros and the luaS_set* functions and macros are for.
Object copying has been changed to copy the whole tagged value
slot. Some changes for object comparisons and hash tables were
needed, too. Dumping/undumping a function always stores the
external type value in pre-compiled chunks.
<p>
The Lua compiler (llex.c, lparser.c, lcode.c) only deals with
strings in the form of TString pointers. To avoid extensive
modifications without any perceived benefit, this has not been
changed. This means the compiler always uses regular strings
internally (even for short strings). They are only converted to
tagged values (regular or fast strings) when they are used as
constants in function prototoypes. All strings used for debug
information (like variable names) are still regular strings.
This turns out not to be a problem because the debug API only
returns string pointers, anyway.
<p>
The patch looks lengthy because of the many tiny changes. But it
has little impact on the resulting code size: it adds only ~1.8K
to the Lua core (with default settings on x86 + gcc 3.3).
<p>
There is one tunable (LUAI_FSTRINGWORDS in luaconf.h) that allows
you to change the default maximum size of fast strings from 11
to 15 characters on 32 bit systems. Note that 64 bit systems
always use a limit of 15 characters (which is the maximum, too).
Please read the description in luaconf.h carefully before setting
this value.
<p>
This may be helpful when a significant percentage of your strings
falls into the range of 12..15 characters. But I have not found
any noticeable performance gains in my tests. So I've opted for
smaller stack/table slots in the default configuration (leaving
LUAI_FSTRINGWORDS undefined).
<p>
<H2>Caveats</H2>
<p>
Fast strings behave like regular strings when used from outside
the Lua/C API boundary. But there are a few subtle differences
that may affect programs that (maybe unknowingly) take advantage
of a few implementation details of the standard Lua VM:
<p>
1. The specification for lua_tostring()/lua_tolstring() says:
"Because Lua has garbage collection, there is no guarantee
that the pointer returned by lua_tostring will be valid after
the corresponding value is removed from the stack."
<p>
Previously you could sometimes get away with destroying the
stack slot for regular strings and still reference the pointer
(because the GC was not run immediately). However this is an
API violation and may cause hard to find bugs.
<p>
Since fast strings return a pointer to the stack slot itself,
non-conformant C modules *definitely* need to be fixed.
<p>
An additional restriction is that a fast string pointer may
get stale if stack slots are moved (lua_insert()). However
this is very rare and can be avoided easily.
<p>
2. The Lua/C API does not guarantee string _pointer_ equality for
identical strings.
<p>
Some authors may have wrongly assumed that because all strings
are shared, the same pointer is always returned for identical
strings. This is not true in the general case. A string may
have been deallocated and newly allocated if there was no
reference to it anywhere in the Lua stack or in a table.
<p>
With fast strings you may get a different pointer for identical
strings, depending on the referenced stack slot. And you may
get the same pointer for different strings, if you happen to
reuse the same stack slot.
<p>
Anyway, nowhere does the Lua/C API specification guarantee
string _pointer_ equality. The only proper test for equality
is to use the lua_equal() or lua_rawequal() API functions.
<p>
C modules making invalid assumptions about string pointer
equality will *definitely* break with the fast string patch.
<p>
3. The Lua/C API specification makes no explicit statement about
Lua stack reallocation. It is implied that string pointers
retrieved from live stack slots are stable even when the Lua
stack is reallocated (moved).
<p>
This is a pure necessity since almost any API call may
reallocate the stack. Some C library calls (e.g. string.gsub())
may break without this guarantee.
<p>
This is the motivation for the fixed stack size workaround in
the prototype implementation (see above under "Implementation
Details").
