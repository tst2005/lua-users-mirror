I'm a self-educated, burned-out, Canadian former software developer currently residing in Wuhan, Hubei, People's Republic of China. My career, before I left it, consisted mostly of work in telephony ranging from embedded systems work, driver design and development and computer telephony toolkit development.  Toward the end, in a radical shift, I moved into working on PKI software.
<p>
I've always been the kind of person who's disdained the "one tool in the tool belt"-style software developers that plague the industry.  (Would you trust an auto mechanic who only uses a crescent wrench and a screwdriver?  Then why do so many people trust software developers who use C/C++ and <em><strong>maybe</strong></em> a simple scripting language?)  To put it more bluntly, I'm a language whore.  I like to pick up new languages like other people like to pick up magazines from tables.  If I find a language that stretches an existing paradigm or, even better, introduces me to a new one I'm happy.
<p>
I started tinkering with Lua back in the v3.2 days.  I've been a loyalist ever since.  Unfortunately I couldn't convince any employers to consider Lua for anything (my last employer embedded <em><strong>Tcl</strong></em> in their product!), one of the myriad of things contributing to my decision to give up software as a career.  Instead I now write my own software for my own amusement or use and, oddly enough, Lua features prominently in much of my software development.
<p>
My current projects (all done part-time) include:
<UL>
<li> a software installation package for Win32 that contains a useful scripting language instead of nasty hack-work;
<li> an end-all, be-all MUD/MUSH/MUX/MUCK/MOO/telnet client that supports downloadable extension modules and really sophisticated end-user scripting;
<li> anything else that strikes my fancy.
</UL>
<p>
Don't hold your breath for any of these....
<p>
<hr>I'm tempted to do a LuaVsC++ page.  The first entry would be:
<p>
<UL>
<li> A complete C++ grammar is dozens of pages long.  The complete Lua grammar fits on one page.
</UL>
