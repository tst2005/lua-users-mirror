<H2>Introduction</H2>
Ruby <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">[1]</a> is a dynamic, object-oriented language similar to Python.
<H3>Similarities</H3>
Both are relatively new, portable, light, high-level languages.
<H3>Differences</H3>
As in <a href="../wiki/LuaVersusPython.html" >LuaVersusPython</a>, (+) equals pros (-) equals cons. (?) equals undecided.
<H3>Ruby</H3>
(+)Ruby is entirely object-oriented. Everything is an object in Ruby.
<p>
(+)Ruby has a large user community and consequently has a large and various collection of libraries and documentation.  
<p>
(?)One Ruby web application framework, Rails, has recently gained wide name recognition.
<p>
(?)Rich syntax with many non-alphanumeric characters used.
<p>
(-)Ruby is not easily embeddable. However, MRuby is very easy to embed.
<p>
<p>
<H3>Lua</H3>
(?)Lua has meta-mechanisms to implement object-orientation.  However it retains the flexibility to rely on other techniques.
<p>
(+) The Lua documentation is very clear and concise.
<p>
(+)Lua has two web-application frameworks, Kepler and Aranha. Both of which continue in the spirit of Lua. Light, extensible, and portable.
<p>
(?) 'One of the main reason that won me over to Lua from Ruby was that Lua already had a very good VM which allows Lua programs
to be compiled and also to execute a lot faster than Ruby (x2 in most cases).'
This might change with the upcoming "MRuby". MRuby is a ruby subset targeted at embedding on small devices, with its own VM.
The development version is publicly available since May 2012 on Github.
Comments in 2013: this has been changed since ruby 1.9 for a while, now ruby also bytecompiles, the benchmark is similar to lua these days. Though luajit does have a edge comparing to ruby, python.
