Two months ago, I was looking for small scripting language to replace a bunch of microperl scripts (Limited and ugly version of Perl). Now we have CLI, configuration wizards and init-scripts of our network devices rewritten in Lua. Asterisk AGI scripts will be rewritten soon. Two most important things about Lua are: 1) The code is much cleaner and flexible than microperl 2) Lua interpreter is significantly smaller than microperl (220 kb vs. 900 kb). This is very important for us because we're limited to ~5MB filesystem. For occasional programmer (like me) learning Lua takes ~2 weeks. // Dmitry Ivanov.

Lua is the Best thing for some jobs! And it's cool to find such site on the web which helps you a lot. Thanks -- <em>Anonymous</em>

This is the highest quality Wiki I've visited so far. Too bad Wikis aren't suited for all communities. -- <em>Thiago Bastos</em>

This is a very good wiki indeed. Great job :-) /Erik
<p>
I also think this is a good wiki/ Danaj

Suggestion: I often come to <a href="../wiki/LuaAddons.html" >LuaAddons</a> to check what's new. However it is hard to see quickly what has been updated on this page. Perhaps we should have a header on this page to show a summary of what has been added or updated?" sam_lie

Nice wiki! /Zigmar

This wiki definitely needs some updating given the huge amount of material only relevant in older versions of Lua. --anonymous
<p>
<DL>
<dt><dd>We have since been heavily updating this.  In particular, Lua 4 content is now being explicitly marked with a <a href="../wiki/VersionNotice.html" >VersionNotice</a>.
</DL>
<p>
All I can say is that this is the WORST formatted and organized Wiki I have ever seen. It's a real shame. --NateW

<dt><dd><em>Hello Nate, I've had some complaints about the wiki structure myself when first stating to use it (see <a href="../wiki/WikiStructure.html" >WikiStructure</a>).  Could you provide more specifics so we know what angle you are coming from?</em>

A few things listed below in decreasing order of importance... --<a href="../wiki/DavidManura.html" >DavidManura</a>

<li> On the page difference display, a unified diff likely will be much more helpful.  I have difficulty quickly understanding changes made to pages (particularly when items get reorganized rather than edited) and often don't bother.
<li> On the backlinks display, it could be helpful to include one sentence or paragraph of context for each backlink.  This will show not just that "A links to B" but the more precise relationship between A and B.  Furthermore, this will assist in checking that the citations for a given page are consistent.
<li> I suggest adding a search box to the top of each page.  Currently, one needs to scroll to the bottom of the page, click Find Page, and enter a search--and I use the search all the time.  Prompting the user to select either "Title search" or "Full search" could be avoided--the search could automatically do both searches and display the title results first followed by the full search (though refinements options to the search could be displayed on the search results page if desired).
<li> How about changing the style sheet to use serif fonts, black color, and headings in italic?  I think that would improve the legibility, give it a cleaner look, and would be consistent with the <a href="http://www.lua.org/lua.css">[lua.org style sheet]</a>.
<li> More types of syntax coloring could be added, mainly C/C++ and Lua interactive mode (e.g. snippets in the <a href="../wiki/LuaTutorial.html" >LuaTutorial</a>).
<li> Is there a way to link to a very recent mail list posting that is not yet indexed on (<a href="/lists/lua-l/">LuaList</a>:...)? (This affected <a href="../wiki/LuaNews.html" >LuaNews</a> especially.)
</UL><DL>
<dt><dd><em>Yes, you can link to Gmane, which is updated in real time. But latter please change the link to one in lua-users.org. --lhf</em>

The wiki is good, but what is the licensing policy for the texts here? Is it compartible with GFDL? Can I use it to produce derivative works? --<a href="../wiki/DmitryGaivoronsky.html" >DmitryGaivoronsky</a>
<p>
Wondering the same thing as Dmitry above. What is the copyright status of the text?
<p>
Make every page's body 900px and centere it with margin:auto;. I do it on every page with firebug and it is a lot easier to read. Learning a lot :) Thanks for all the great information! -Frank

Q: I'm not sure where to ask a beginner question, so I'll put it here: is there any way with ordinary, un-fooled-around-with Lua for Windows, to obtain the filename (including directory location) if you drag and drop a file onto your script's icon?  All I want to do is to have scripts to process files - open the file, do some stuff to it, produce an output file - so I assume that if I have the filename the standard io can do the rest.  Because CD-ing around in the morass of Windows is a RPITA.  And if it isn't ... then WHY is it so freakin' hard?
<p>
A: Good question. I recommend to ask at Lua mailing list &lt;lua-l@lists.lua.org&gt; in a terse but polite way w/o any expression of opinion (and to delete your question and my reply afterwards).
