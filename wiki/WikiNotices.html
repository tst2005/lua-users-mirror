The wiki database was corrupted by a malicous user on sourceforge.net.  The site was restored from a backup dated May 7 5:00 UTC.

The wiki database was corrupted by a malicous user on sourceforge.net for a third time.  The site was restored from a backup dated November 30 6:00 UTC.

It seems that sourceforge had a serious bug in their web statistics.  So lua-users.org has been getting more than 1-3 hits per day after all... <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/stats/?group_id=32250">[1]</a>.
<p>
<H3>December 3, 2001</H3>
We are now doing automated offsite backups of all lua-users.org data.  Thanks to <a href="../wiki/MartinSpernau.html" >MartinSpernau</a> for providing a backup repository and debug help.  Five weeks are covered using eleven backups (seven at an interval of one day and four at an interval of one week).  These backups are intended for catastrophe recovery, not for information archival.

It seems like there are still some wiki-unfriendly web browsers out there, such as Konqueror (still a problem as of 2.2.1).  Konqueror will corrupt all incoming tabs, converting them to a single space.  A bug report has been submitted, but the outcome is uncertain as browser developers tend to have strong opinions regarding the handling (or not handling) of tabs in text forms.  If Konquerer doesn't shape up, this wiki system will have to change to a tab-less markup.

<DL>
<dt><dd>For IE you can copy and paste tabs from somewhere else (or an existing tab on the page).  Anyway that's not the issue here since the wiki lets you use either spaces or tabs for indenting.  The problem is Konquerer killing tabs that already exist on the page.

The wiki database was malicously corrupted a second time, but again no content was lost.  The sourceforge.net administrators don't seem to be in any hurry to put a long-term solution in place (such as cgiwrap <a href="http://cgiwrap.unixtools.org/">[2]</a>).  It's annoying...

The wiki database was corrupted by a malicous user on sourceforge.net.  The site was restored from a backup dated October 5th, 11:34 PST.  We need to put an automated backup system in place.  (A request for help has been listed on <a href="../wiki/HelpWanted.html" >HelpWanted</a> for some time).

The wiki pages now pass HTML validation at <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">http://validator.w3.org/</a>.  <img src="http://www.w3.org/Icons/valid-html32.png">

The recent changes "show minor edits" preference has been replaced with "show change details".  The new option lists every edit occurrence in order, including minor edits.  This option really should not be used normally.  It's for the paranoid (say, site admins) who fear some pages are being altered behind their back.
<p>
The file area for attachments is up.  There is a link "file manager" in the toolbar of the edit page.  The root of the file manager maps to <code>Files:wiki_insecure/</code>.  For example <a href="/files/wiki_insecure/test.txt">Files:wiki_insecure/test.txt</a>.
<p>
<H3>August 12, 2001</H3>
The "==" and "===" heading markups have been swapped.  "===" is now used for the more prominent heading.

Certain versions of Mozilla-based browsers (Mozilla and Netscape 6) will corrupt tab characters when doing cut &amp; paste in an edit window.  Please avoid using such browsers on this wiki.  Here is the status of this bug on each browser:
<UL>
<li> Netscape 6 - version 6.1 (final) or better is ok
<li> Mozilla - version 0.9.3 or better is ok
</UL>
