Metalua is an alternative Lua compiler supporting compile-time metaprogramming and syntax
extensions.  It also contains a pure Lua library for parsing Lua source into ASTs.
<p>
<H2>Description</H2>
<p>
Metalua is backward compatible with Lua 5.1.  You can dynamically add new idioms in the
language, and provide metaprograms, i.e. programs which are run while the
compiler is compiling another file and can read / modify /write /
manipulate the program being compiled.
<p>
<H3>Usefulness</H3>
<p>
The practical interest is that you can extend the language, typically
by importing a concept from other languages: you define a new syntax,
and a manipulating function that turns this new idiom into a valid
(although probably longer, harder to read and maintain) Lua
program. Examples include proper support for various OO styles,
ML-style structural pattern matching, design by contract, static or runtime type
checking, lazy evaluation, list generation by comprehension...
<p>
<H3>Status</H3>
<p>
Metalua development is still in alpha stage).
<p>
<H3>Abstract syntax trees</H3>
<p>
The secret for efficient manipulation of any data is to represent it
at the right abstraction level. Programs can be represented in many
ways: as ASCII source files, token streams, abstract syntax trees,
bytecode, compiled binary files... However, the consensus is that the
most practical representation for automated program manipulation is
the abstract syntax tree (AST). Since human users prefer plain text
sources, Metalua lets you work with AST as well as plain text, mix
them as you see fit, and offers facilities to translate from a format
to another.
<p>
<H3>Learning curve</H3>
<p>
Writing extensions in metalua is not trivial: you need to know AST
structure, to have a clear understanding of what metalevels are, and
to be at ease shifting from one metalevel to another without getting
confused. Obviously, mastering Lua is a must.
<p>
However, it's important to realize that if designing an extension is
often not easy, using a <em>well designed</em> one should be easy.
<p>
This design is consistent with Lua's: it's easy, even for
non-developers, to write basic programs. But if you want to do
advanced things, you'll need to master non-trivial notions such as
coroutines, environments, metatables, weak tables, higher order
functions, etc. Rather than avoiding at all cost the need to look
under the hood, Lua keeps it clean under that hood, so that advanced
users can hack it with confidence. Notice that if it's not so easy to
write, say, a proper API around a userdatum, using it should be be
easy if it's properly designed.
<p>
This "shamelessly easier to use than write" approach is also similar
to C++'s templates, although pretending that C++ is easy to use is a
bit of a stretch: if you really think so, mastering metalua will
really feel like a stroll in the park.
<p>
If you feel like metalua's idiosyncrasies are the hardest part of your
extension design, it might mean that you're underestimating the
complexity of implementing a correct extension, including the one
you're writing.
<p>
<H3>Metalua vs. Lisp</H3>
<p>
Although Metalua technically allows to write programs with lots of
small ad-hoc macros, as one often does in Lisp, it's not the intended
purpose, and is not encouraged. Although macros can be very handy,
especially in single coder projects developing everything from
scratch, the price to pay in terms of readability and interoperability
is often not worth it.
<p>
Lisp values freedom at all costs, and lets users write pretty much
what they want without much guidance. It can become an issue if you
ever have to work with some code not written by an outstanding hacker.
At the other extreme, some extremely dull languages are a pain to work
with, but grow a wealth of useful, robust and well maintained
libraries. The aims with metalua are to:
<UL>
<li> support macros when they're worth it: to embrace new paradygms.
<li> make it possible, yet clearly cumbersome, to write frivolous macros: programmers are allowed to write poor code, but they should be made aware of how poor it is.
<li> have a "proper" syntax: syntax is important, it decides what's idiomatic and what isn't. It gives programmers the Knowledge of Good and Evil.
<li> Let extension designers decide what's Good and what isn't, by giving them some latitude in syntactical support.
<li> Yet encourage them to use sensible syntaxes, by providing standard extension entrypoints in the grammar, which make it easier to respect the spirit of Lua's syntax.
</UL>
<p>
<H2>Examples</H2>
<p>
Since Metalua manipulates a lot of trees, having pattern matching as
in ML is very convinient. Such an extension is available in the
language, and lets write things like below. Notice the presence of
<code>-{ extension 'foobar'</code>} statements in the source: it loads
extensions in the compiler, and by listing them you know which exact
dialect of the language is used. You also don't need to remember how
to compile each individual source file: this information is stored in
it.

<p>
What's interesting to see is how close the example above is from
OCaml, the language from which the pattern matching idiom has been
borrowed:
<p>
<pre>

(* Type declaration: OCaml is a statically typed language! *)

type term =

| Var    of string

| Apply  of term * term

| Lambda of string * term



let rec replace var newval term =

   match term with

   | Var(v) when v==var       -&gt; newval

   | Var(_)                   -&gt; term

   | Lambda(v, _) when v==var -&gt; term

   | Lambda(v, b)             -&gt; Lambda(v, replace var newval b)

   | Apply(f, x)              -&gt; Apply(replace var newval f, replace var newval x)



let rec reduce_whnf term =

   match term with

   | Apply(Lambda(param, body), arg) -&gt;

     let x = replace param arg body in

     reduce_whnf x

   | _ -&gt; term

</pre>
<p>
A last example will show how an extension implementation looks
like. We'll introduce the often begged for ternary choice operator,
a.k.a. C's "?:" conditional. Since ":" is already used by Lua for
method invocation, we'll make it "<code>bool ? foo, bar</code>" rather than
"<code>bool ? foo : bar</code>". A correct (although inefficient) way to encode it
is to put it in a function: "<code>(function() if bool then return foo else return bar end end)()</code>".
This is implemented as:
<p>
<pre class="code">
<span class="keyword">local</span> <span class="keyword">function</span> t_builder(bool, suffix)

   <span class="keyword">local</span> foo, bar = <span class="library">unpack</span> (suffix)

   <span class="keyword">return</span> +{ (<span class="keyword">function</span>() <span class="keyword">if</span> -{bool} <span class="keyword">then</span> -{foo} <span class="keyword">else</span> -{bar} <span class="keyword">end</span> <span class="keyword">end</span>)() }

<span class="keyword">end</span>



mlp.expr.suffix:add{ <span class="string">"?"</span>, mlp.expr, <span class="string">","</span> mlp.expr, builder=t_builder }

</pre>
