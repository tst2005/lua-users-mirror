I used Lua 3.2 and Lua 4.0 extensively in a video game project for a non-PC platform.  Due to commercial considerations I can say very little about the project.  Lua was used for configuration, for persistent representations of game objects, for some game logic, tool creation, and run-time debugging/inspection/modification of the game.
<p>
I have several years experience in writing Lua, embedding Lua into existing applications, and generally interfacing C-like things to Lua-like things.
<p>
I am a professional software consultant and will hack Lua for money.  I have extensive knowledge of lua 4.0 and C and a little knowledge of 5.0 and 5.1.
<p>
I am a memory management expert (as in garbage collection).  I cowrote a memory management framework called the Memory Pool System which is downloadable from <a href="http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/">http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/</a> and is available under commercial licensing terms (as well as a more open license).
<p>
I have extensive knowledge of Unix (I use OS X and FreeBSD currently, and have used all sorts in the past), including Unix programming in C, shell, awk.  I like to focus on C, shell, and awk because they are guaranteed to be available on any POSIX system (well, shell and awk are, and C is an option), and nothing else is.
<p>
I like to dabble in languages and have used ML, Lisp, python, Modula-3, scheme, BASIC, perl, Icon, BCPL, Dylan, Logo and quite possibly lots of others.
I program a bit in assembler and still like to at least read the Programmer's Reference Manual for the hardware I am using.
I have programmed assembler for Intel IA32 (aka x86), SPARC, DEC Alpha, MIPS R4000, PowerPC, Motorola 68K, Zilog Z80, PIC18F, Rockwell 6502, and perhaps a few others.
I'm comfortable reading code at the instruction level, in order to discover compiler bugs or bugs in somebody else's compiled code for example.
<p>
I like to rock climb, play video games, listen to music, watch films, read books, eat food, drink real ale, wine, and single malts.
