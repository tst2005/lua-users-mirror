<H2>Summary</H2>
<p>
There have been repeated discussions on lua-l (for example <a href="http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2007-03/msg00846.html">[1]</a>) about the cost of passing strings from <code>C</code> into <code>Lua</code>, with the implication that it is a major overhead. This page seeks to document an experiment in modifying Lua to reduce string creation overhead by implementing "prestrings" -- lazily interned strings. A sample API is outlined, and the results of a benchmark test of a proof-of-concept implementation of the API are presented.
<p>
The proposed API cannot be used safely in a threaded environment without severe restrictions which might be difficult to guarantee. In addition, the benchmark results do not indicate the potential for significant speed-up in common use cases.
<p>
In short, this is more of a failed experhiment than a suggestion, but it's useful to report failures as well in order to avoid reinventing flat wheels.
<p>
<H2>Stringing along</H2>
<p>
Basically, the process the Lua API follows when importing a string into Lua, either with <code>lua_pushlstring()</code> or as the result of a primitive which creates a new string, is:
<p>
1) A hash is computed out of a sample of no more than 32 characters of the string.
<p>
2) Using the hash, the string is looked up in the global interned-string hash table.
<p>
3) If an existing string is found, then it is used.
<p>
4) Otherwise, a new <code>TString</code> object is allocated and the string is copied into it.
The new object is inserted into the intern table using the hash value computed
at step 1.
<p>
This works particularly well for shortish strings which are likely to already exist in the
intern table, such as global variable names and other table keys, since it avoids
unnecessarily allocating or copying the provided string, although it will incur the
cost of a full comparison of the new string with one existing string.
<p>
It also works reasonably well for strings which are unlikely to already exist in
the intern table since the hash lookup will probably never compare more than
a few characters of any existing string on the chain, although it will incur
the cost of a memory allocation and a copy.
<p>
Nonetheless, there remain some use cases where these overheads seem like they
might be excessive. Some people worry that the cost of interning is too high
for a string which will never be used as a table key, while others focus on
the copy in step 4, above, which may be unnecessary if the string is going to
be constructed piecemeal or created by some other library which expects a
fixed-length buffer (for example, <code>fread</code>.)
<p>
<H2>The evolution of an API</H2>
<p>
Since I belong to the second group, I thought it might be useful to find a
way to allow the creation of a new string without copying. On the surface,
this looks easy: you simply create something which looks like a string (or
at least is the same size as a string would be) and provide the starting
address; the API consumer can then fill the contents in as desired and then
convert the object into a real string, by interning it.
<p>
That suggested a simple API:
<DL>
<dt><dd><pre>

   lua_newprestring(L, size);

   lua_tostring(L, index);

   /* Note that lua_tostring is a macro which expands

    * to lua_tolstring(L, index, NULL);

    */

</pre>
</DL>
The first call creates a "prestring" (i.e. something which can be converted
to a string) of a given size, and the second one converts the prestring to a
string. Using <code>lua_tolstring</code> for this purpose seemed clear and obvious.
<p>
Now, the prestring is a real Lua object, so it could theoretically be returned
from a C function as an uninterned string. And since it is turned into a real
string by calling <code>lua_tolstring</code> on it, and since <code>lua_tostring</code> is the API
for extracting a string's address and length, no modification of standard
library functions is necessary in order to use prestrings, although it turns
out to be useful to have an API call which allows the use of the prestring
without interning it:
<DL>
<dt><dd><pre>

   lua_rawtolstring(L, index, &amp;len);

</pre>
</DL>
<p>
I could have hijacked <code>lua_topointer</code>, but <code>lua_topointer</code> doesn't return
the string length; furthermore, it's good to know that the object at a
stack index is actually a string, and not just anything which might
have a pointer.
<p>
My first attempt to use the API was to write a <code>file</code> method <code>:buffers</code>,
which is a fixed-length analog to <code>:lines</code>:
<DL>
<dt><dd><pre class="code">
   <span class="keyword">for</span> b <span class="keyword">in</span> f:buffers(2000) <span class="keyword">do</span>

     <span class="comment">-- #b is 2000 unless there are fewer than</span>

     <span class="comment">-- 2000 characters to read</span>

   <span class="keyword">end</span>

</pre>

</DL>
<code>:buffers</code> could just return a string, but it seemed more interesting
to return a prestring, in case the use of the return value didn't require
interning: say, if it were just going to be sent to some output. In that
case, <code>:buffer</code> could even reuse the same prestring on each iteration,
provided that it hadn't been stringified. (This is not entirely safe since the
client program could keep a reference to the buffer, even though it
hasn't been interned, and might get surprised that the value changes.)
<p>
That meant that the implementation of <code>:buffer</code> needs to be able to know
whether or not the prestring has been stringified, and that required
another API:
<DL>
<dt><dd><pre>

   lua_rawtoprestring(L, index, &amp;len);

</pre>
</DL>
which returns the address of the contents of the prestring at index, if
it is a prestring, and otherwise NULL.
<p>
Using <code>lua_rawtoprestring</code> and <code>lua_newprestring</code>, <code>:buffer</code> can
decide to either recycle a prestring or create a new one, but for reasons
which now seem hard to justify, I added yet another API which combines
the two actions; the most semantically complicated API call in the
implementation:
<DL>
<dt><dd><pre>

   lua_toprestring(L, index, &amp;len);

</pre>
</DL>
which examines the object at stack slot <code>index</code> and:
<p>
1) if it is a prestring, does not modify it;
<p>
2) if it is a string, creates a new prestring with the same length
(without copying contents) and replaces stack slot <code>index</code> with
the new prestring;
<p>
3) if it is anything else, creates a new prestring whose length is
the value currently pointed to by the <code>&amp;len</code> argument, and
replaces stack slot <code>index</code> with the new prestring;
<p>
4) finally, regardless of which of the above was performed,
returns the address and length of the prestring at stack slot
<code>index</code>
<p>
Although that's hard to explain, and maybe hard to understand, it's
quite easy to use. For example, the implementation of :buffers is
as follows:
<DL>
<dt><dd><pre>

static int io_readbuf (lua_State *L) {

  FILE *f = *(FILE **)lua_touserdata(L, lua_upvalueindex(1));

  if (f == NULL)

    luaL_error(L, "file is already closed");

  else {

    size_t nread;

    size_t toread = lua_tointeger(L, lua_upvalueindex(2));

    char *buf = lua_toprestring(L, lua_upvalueindex(3), &amp;toread);

    nread = fread(buf, 1, toread, f);

    if (nread == toread)

      lua_pushvalue(L, lua_upvalueindex(3));

    else if (nread &gt; 0)

      lua_pushlstring(L, buf, nread);

    else if (ferror(f))

      luaL_error(L, "%s", strerror(errno));

    else

      lua_pushnil(L);

  }

  return 1;

}



static int f_buffers (lua_State *L) {

  size_t bufsize;

  tofile(L);

  bufsize = luaL_optinteger(L, 2, LUAL_BUFFERSIZE);

  lua_settop(L, 1);

  lua_pushinteger(L, bufsize);

  lua_pushnil(L);

  lua_pushcclosure(L, io_readbuf, 3);

  return 1;

}

</pre>
</DL>
<p>
<H2>A prestring is just a nascent string</H2>
<p>
A key part of this entire process is that the prestring is converted
<strong>in place</strong> into a string either explicitly or when needed. Prestrings
don't have a separate type; they look at all times like ordinary strings,
unless one of the above prestring-aware API calls is used. Existing
C modules and Lua programs do not need to be modified in any way to take
into account the existence of prestrings, and if you want a C module to avoid
autointerning a prestring, one only needs to replace <code>lua_tolstring</code> with
<code>lua_rawtolstring</code>. 
<p>
Since a prestring is really a lazily-interned string, it has to act as though
it were a string the Lua environment. That means that it has to
be interned in order to be used as a table key. (The proof-of-concept
implementation also auto-interns prestrings which are arguments to ==.)
<p>
Once a prestring is interned into a string, it must not
be changed. So it's not really safe to modify a prestring which has
been released into the Lua environment. You must finish creating the
contents of the prestring before letting any Lua or CFunction see
the prestring.
<p>
That's fine in a non-threaded environment, and the above implementation
of <code>:buffers</code> will work; it is careful not to modify the prestring without
checking to make sure that it still is a prestring. But it cannot be made
to work safely in a threaded environment; the <code>:buffers</code> iteration function
does not run inside of the <code>lua_lock</code> and another process which had a
reference to the buffer could stringify it while the call to <code>fread</code> were
in progress.
<p>
That's unfortunate because the benchmarks I ran against the proof-of-concept
implementation show that the only significant speed-up available is through
recycling prestrings in a hard loop. The overhead of interning and even
copying strings is just not enough to justify the complexity of the
implementation (in my opinion).
<p>
<H2>Trying to benchmark</H2>
<p>
The first benchmark I tried was reading and writing file buffers, using
a function rather similar to <code>:buffers</code> as shown above. The <code>iolib</code>
was modified by adding the <code>:buffers</code> iterator and replacing a few
calls to <code>lua_tolstring</code> with <code>lua_rawtostring</code>. However, all of 
the timings were dominated by the I/O system calls, so the results
were not conclusive, except in the sense that they demonstrate that in
a normal usage with file I/O, the savings are not even going to be
noticeable.
<p>
In order to try to measure more exactly what the benefits might be,
I created a sort of pseudo-file, which consists of just under 16K
random printable characters in a ringbuffer. The ring buffer is
"read" by copying the number of requested bytes and advancing the
internal "file" position, always modulo the ringbuffer size (which
is a prime). Periodically, the ring buffer is rerandomized; the 
end result is that it is extremely unlikely that a given "read"
will result in an existing string.
<p>
Using the above API, there are at least four possible ways of
returning a buffer of characters:
<p>
1) "recycle": Always return the same prestring, with new contents
<p>
2) "prestring": Return a new prestring each time, but don't intern it
<p>
3) "inplace": Create the new string by first creating a prestring of
the correct size, then reading data into it, and finally turning the
prestring into a string before returning it.
<p>
4) "string": The current mechanism: the file is read into a prestring
(although it could just as well have been a preallocated buffer), and
then <code>lua_pushlstring</code> is called to create a string in the normal way.
<p>
Comparing the times for these four strategies reveals the cost of
<p>
1) allocating memory (the difference between "prestring" and "recycle")
<p>
2) interning (the difference between "inplace" and "prestring"); and
<p>
3) copying (the difference between "string" and "inplace").
<p>
The benchmark was done rather unscientifically on a laptop running
Xubuntu (I tried to avoid using the machine while the benchmark was
running, but there were still lots of processes active). Lua was
compiled with <code>-O2 -DLUA_USE_APICHECK</code> (it should have been
compiled without <code>LUA_USE_APICHECK</code> although I don't think that
affects the relative timings; obviously, the execution times reported
are slower than they should be in a production build. The machine is
an AMD Turion running in a 64-bit environment. For each buffer size,
the simulated file size was set to 1,000,000 buffers and execution
time was collected with <code>os.clock</code>, so the results can be read as
µs per buffer. Each test was run ten times and the fastest time
was selected for the summary; the results are summarized in
<a href="/files/wiki_insecure/users/rici/buftest.pdf">Files:wiki_insecure/users/rici/buftest.pdf</a>. As can be seen, the
interning time is on the order of 200-250 nanoseconds per string,
which is only noticeable for very short strings; the copying time
is at worst 13% of the total, with the largest buffers tested.
<p>
<H2>Proof of Concept</H2>
<p>
The implementation is not particularly polished, and since the results
were not spectacular, I'm unlikely to continue develop it. In case
anyone is interested, I've put a patch at <a href="/files/wiki_insecure/users/rici/prestring.diff">Files:wiki_insecure/users/rici/prestring.diff</a>
<p>
Some notes on the implementation:
<p>
<H2>Garbage Collection</H2>
<p>
Every garbage collectable object has a <code>next</code> member which Lua uses
to perform the sweep phase of the garbage collection. Objects other
than strings are kept in a singly-linked list whose head is in the
global state. Strings, however, are kept in the string intern table,
and the <code>next</code> member is used to link together hash chains. (In effect,
the head of each hash chain is part of the garbage collection root.)
<p>
Once a prestring has been interned, it must be removed from the allocated
object linked list and linked into the appropriate hash chain in the intern
table. The only way I could think of doing that was to doubly-link the list
of allocated prestrings. The back pointer is kept in a <code>union</code> with the
<code>hash</code> member, which is not needed by prestrings. On 32-bit architectures,
this has no cost, but on 64-bit architectures it increases the string overhead
from 24 bytes to 32 bytes, since <code>hash</code> is an <code>int</code>. Possibly it would
have been better to just assume that there will never be a lot of prestrings,
and to keep them in a singly-linked list which is just searched linearly when
a prestring is interned.
<p>
Other than that, I don't think there are any GC issues. Like strings,
prestrings are always created on the stack and can be created white
since the stack is marked atomically.
<p>
<H2>Locking</H2>
<p>
The lock mechanism offered by the <code>lua_lock</code> and <code>lua_unlock</code> macros is
designed to avoid garbage collection or table resizing from interfering
with API calls or VM execution. Lua does not attempt, even in theory, to
prevent race conditions from other object mutations.
<p>
Prestrings introduce a new form of mutation: changing a mutable object
(a prestring) into an immutable object (a string). As noted above, the
<code>lua_lock</code> mechanism cannot prevent a race between changing the
contents of a prestring and changing a prestring to a string.
<p>
<H2>Other notes</H2>
<p>
Prestrings have the same type as strings (<code>LUA_TSTRING</code>) and have the
same memory layout other than the <code>hash</code> member. One flag was added to
the object header to distinguish prestrings from strings.
<p>
When a prestring is interned, it is possible that the result will be
an existing string. In this case, we'll end up with two objects:
the prestring and the old string. This could result in the same prestring
being interned multiple times. To reduce the possibility of this happening,
the autointerning done by key lookup and the equality operator both reset
the string pointer to the old string; implementing that required changing
a number of internal prototypes from const to non-const, and without doing
much to solve the problem.
<p>
I think it would probably better to stash a forwarding pointer in the
prestring (using the overloaded back pointer/hash) and rewriting the
string pointer during garbage collection. (The garbage collector could
not rewrite pointers in the stack frame of a C call but ought to be
able to rewrite them elsewhere. Rewriting a pointer in a C call stack
frame could result in the prestring being freed by the garbage collector
while the C function was using a pointer to the prestring.)
