Recently, the Lua team put together a live demo of Lua that runs via the web<a href="http://www.lua.org/cgi-bin/demo">[7]</a>. This is a step in the right direction for giving people a chance to experience the language without needing to download anything. Unfortunately it's in very much "proof of concept" mode at the moment, and there are number of improvements that could be made to make it a more educational demonstration (see <a href="http://tryruby.hobix.com/">[Try Ruby!]</a>).

<p>
The Open Scripting Architecture<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptX/Concepts/osa.html">[8]</a> is an extendible mechanism for inter-application communication in Mac OS X.  Although originally designed for Applescript, it is possible to support other languages and their are OSA implementations of Ruby<a href="http://rubyosa.rubyforge.org/">[9]</a>, Java<code></code>Script<a href="http://www.latenightsw.com/freeware/JavaScriptOSA/">[10]</a>, Perl (supposedly).
<p>
This project entails writing a library to allow Lua scripts to respond to OSA events.

<hr><H3>Lua Objective-C Bridge</H3>
<p>
<strong>Mentor:</strong> Eric Wing, (more to come?)
<p>
<strong>Level:</strong> hard
<p>
The Lua bridge to Objective-C<a href="http://luaforge.net/projects/luaobjc/">[11]</a> is a language binding between Lua and Objective-C. The current implementation currently works, but is very basic, especially compared to other language bridges such as Py<code></code>ObjC<a href="http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/">[12]</a> and Ruby<code></code>Cocoa<a href="http://rubycocoa.sourceforge.net/">[13]</a>. The primary users of Obj-C are Cocoa developers that develop for OS X. In Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, Apple shipped'Bridge Support' which is intended to help language bridges more easily cover all of Apple's APIs, including ones that are C-based (not just Obj-C based). The (ambitious) goal of this next generation Lua/Obj-C Bridge is to make the Lua binding first class, on the level of Py<code></code>ObjC and Ruby<code></code>Cocoa. A secondary goal is to also consider how to build/apply the bridge to OS X on the iPhone as Lua is sufficiently small and easy enough to embed in an application, whereas embedding PyObjC or Ruby<code></code>Cocoa may be less appealing in this environment.
<p>
This project may be too big for a 2 month project, but would probably benefit from any groundwork that can be done in this period.

Some of the tasks that might be suitable for SOC:
<p>
<strong>Level:</strong> Medium
<p>
Improving the acquisition of the Qt interface for tolua++. Currently, the Qt interface exposed to tolua++ is provided with the lua_qt package, on a series of .pkg files which are difficult to maintain. Using a more automated way to obtain the Qt interface (such as parsing the output from gccxml or a similar tool) would make it easier to keep up-to-date. This would be implemented as an add-on to tolua++, distributed with lua_qt (no need to patch/recompile tolua++).
<p>
<strong>Level:</strong> Medium
<p>
Implementing Qt-specific features that are 'scripting-language-friendly', such as Qt's property system, or things that are not accessible through the standard c++ interface, like qlinguist (more examples needed).
<p>
<strong>Level:</strong> Easy (should probably be combined with another task)
<p>
Cross platform building/distribution. The package should easily build under all platforms supported (linux, osx, mingw, visual studio (assuming qt's free distribution is buildable with microsoft's tools)).

Mod_wombat is a module for the Apache webserver that enables a programmer to use Lua for scripting web pages.  The source code resides in the Apache subversion repository and can be accessed at <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/mod_wombat/">[18]</a>.  Slides from Brian's talk on mod_wombat internals can be found at <a href="http://kasparov.skife.org/blog/src/wombat/wombat_ac_us_07.html">[19]</a>.
<p>
There are a number of tasks to be undertaken to improve mod_wombat. See <a href="../wiki/ModWombat.html" >ModWombat</a> for details.

<strong>Level:</strong> easy to hard
<p>
Sputnik<a href="http://sputnik.freewisdom.org">[20]</a> is a "generalized wiki" written in Lua.  (Sputnik looks like a wiki out of the box but is designed to be extended and
eventually turned into something entirely different.)  There are many things that could be done, and the tasks vary from relatively easy to fairly difficult.
<p>
By far the most needed task is:
<p>
<UL>
<li> Indexing: Integrate an indexing system into Sputnik's backend (hard)
</UL>
<p>
Other tasks are:
<p>
<UL>
<li> A blog module: Make Sputnik work like a blog (easy)
<li> PDF generation: integrate with LuaTex<a href="/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=edit&amp;id=LuaTex" >?</a> or something like this (easy)
<li> Improved UI: Find a way to simplify the UI while keeping the flexibility (medium)
<li> Add AJAX: add ajax in a way that allows the nodes currenly viewed by the client to query other nodes on the server (medium)
<li> Caching: provide a good caching solution (medium)
<li> Backend analysis: Investigate the advantages and disadvantages of Sputnik's backend (Versium/Saci) in comparison to alternatives such as CouchDB (hard)
</UL>

<a href="http://www.cmake.org">[CMake]</a> is a cross-platform, open-source build system, and provides a family of tools designed to build, test and package software. Famous C++ based <a href="http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Projects">[projects]</a> like KDE4, or Scribus use it. CMake currently supports only a home-grown scripting language.
<p>
Here <a href="http://www.assembla.com/spaces/CMakeLua">[CMakeLua]</a> comes in: its intending is to supplement, and in the long run to replace, CMake's scripting language with Lua. 
<p>
CMake is written in C++ and builds on all common platform, therefore you need at least some C++ knowledge. 
<p>
Tasks:
<p>
<UL>
<li> A basic Lua binding has been done, and now the real work of making a fully usable project needs to begin.
<li> Among the challenges is to bridge native CMake-script variables across to Lua variables so legacy CMake scripts and projects can interoperate with new Lua-based scripts. 
<li> Porting of native CMake-scripts to Lua in the core distribution also could be done. 
<li> Design decisions need to be made to decide how to balance traditional CMake-isms with Lua-isms.
<li> Real world test on big projects should be done.
<li> Eventually integrate the changes into the official CMake code base.
</UL>
<p>
Within the 2 months this project could reach a mature develoment status, and has the chance to go upstream into the official CMake repository.

<p>
Auctioneer<a href="http://auctioneeraddon.com">[21]</a> is an open source AddOn<a href="/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=edit&amp;id=AddOn" >?</a> for World of Warcraft. Its purpose is to provide a market price for items listed inside of the World of Warcraft Auction House. However these prices change over time, so an idea we've had for a while is to implement an in-game graphing module to visually represent the changes in price over a period of time.
<p>
This project would require the creation of a stats module to gather the raw statistical information from Auctioneer Advanced (API already available). The other major component is the creation of a graphics lib to be able to draw simple graphs in-game. For more information, please login to <a href="irc://chat.us.freenode.net/Norganna">irc://chat.us.freenode.net/Norganna</a> and ask for <a href="../wiki/MentalPower.html" >MentalPower</a>.

The idea is to generically describe and validate the constraints of Lua configuration data (i.e. a Foo is a list of 0 or more Bar; a Bar is a table containing 1 or more string keys pointing to Zig, Zag or Foo; so on and so forth).
<p>
We've looked for such a tool before at work, and the closest we found
was an example Norman Ramsey posted<a href="/lists/lua-l/lua-l/2006-12/msg00584.html">[27]</a>, which was interesting to play around with, but not general enough to cover any but our simplest cases.
<p>
Ideally, the syntax would be succinct yet expressive. For instance, compare Relax NG's compact syntax with it's regular syntax (or with other XML schema validation syntaxes).

There are a number of Object-Oriented languages that don't use classes to organize objects.  Instead, new objects are created by cloning existing objects and any object can have its properties dynamically modified.  Example languages include Self<a href="http://research.sun.com/self/language.html">[22]</a>, Java<code></code>Script<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript.html">[23]</a>, Io<a href="http://www.iolanguage.com/">[24]</a>, and Newtonscript<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewtonScript.html">[25]</a>.
<p>
This project involves designing and implementing a metaobject protocol (MOP) in Lua that would enable prototype-based programming.
