# Work done on this repository

 * download the original html page (on the official website)
 * fix all line termination (from DOS/Windows, Mac) to Unix
 * fix the charset, try to convert to UTF-8.
 * transforme absolute link to relative link.
 * rename all converted page name (suffix with .html), because local browser does not try to add .html if no page found.
 * make script to do the stuff automatically

# TODO

 * change /cgi-bin/... links to something else (maybe an empty target ?)
 * also see to hide or remove the preferences, edit, history, diff links.
 * fix the bug of double-newline on 'pre' html part (sampel in CurriedLua.html or ModuleDefinition.html)
 * refresh all pages, download again (4 month old)

Have Fun !
