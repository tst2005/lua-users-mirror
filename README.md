You should also browse this repository offline.

Work done on this repository :
 * dowmload the original html page (on the official website)
 * fix all line termination (from DOS/Windows, Mac) to Unix
 * fix the charset, try to convert to UTF-8.
 * transforme absolute link to relative link.
 * rename all converted page name (suffix with .html), because local browser does not try to add .html if no page found.
 * make script to do the stuff automatically
 
Have Fun !
